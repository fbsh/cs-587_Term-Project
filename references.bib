Alternatively characterized as an antidote to bureaucracy or a license to hack they’ve stirred up interest all over the software landscape. In this essay I explore the reasons for lightweight methods, focusing not so much on their weight but on their adaptive nature and their people-first orientation. I also give a summary and references to the processes in this school and consider the factors that should influence your choice of whether to go down this newly trodden path.},

	abstract = {Municipal developmental projects are typically embedded in complex, dynamic environments involving many unpredictable components with diverse stakeholders and are characterised by a high degree of uncertainty. Most projects fail - largely because conventional project management methodology cannot adequately adjust to a dynamic environment. In a rapidly changing environment a highly adaptive model for planning and managing projects is required. Managing projects under conditions of complexity and uncertainty challenges the project team to be creative and adaptive. This requires a shift in thinking about projects and how they should be organised and delivered. Also known as �agile� Project Management, Adaptive Project Management (APM) is an approach to projects for which traditional methods are inappropriate. The fundamental concept underlying APM is that scope is variable, and that continuous customer input is key to success. It is the purpose of this article to explore the potential contributions of APM as a more effective and realistic tool for project planning and execution in a turbulent municipal planning context.},

Purposeful planning is what ensures that the executive actions undertaken remain connected to the goals and outcomes expected by the stakeholders. There is no single approach to planning a project, but neither is project planning a free-for-all. This book takes you through many of the common planning situations you will meet, addressing how planning decisions alter depending on the project context. It also discusses how resource-constrained planning differs from end-date schedule planning. The authors look at what is different between cost-constrained plans and time boxing and they discuss why you must plan when using Agile, and how to plan for innovation, as well as planning when managing a project portfolio, and what planning means in a program. To tell this story, we have distilled over seventy years of our combined personal experience of supporting project managers deliver, and thousands of person-years of others’ practical knowledge to illustrate tools, models, and approaches that suggest what to do in what circumstances. Also available are supplementary materials and tools, on a website associated with the book, which we hope you find useful when you plan your next project!},

The added chapters contain (1) a crisp condensation of all the propositions asserted in the original book, including Brooks' central argument in The Mythical Man-Month: that large programming projects suffer management problems different from small ones due to the division of labor; that the conceptual integrity of the product is therefore critical; and that it is difficult but possible to achieve this unity; (2) Brooks' view of these propositions a generation later; (3) a reprint of his classic 1986 paper "No Silver Bullet"; and (4) today's thoughts on the 1986 assertion, "There will be no silver bullet within ten years."},

              The origin and early dispersal of speakers of Transeurasian languages—that is, Japanese, Korean, Tungusic, Mongolic and Turkic—is among the most disputed issues of Eurasian population history
              1–3
              . A key problem is the relationship between linguistic dispersals, agricultural expansions and population movements
              4,5
              . Here we address this question by ‘triangulating’ genetics, archaeology and linguistics in a unified perspective. We report wide-ranging datasets from these disciplines, including a comprehensive Transeurasian agropastoral and basic vocabulary; an archaeological database of 255 Neolithic–Bronze Age sites from Northeast Asia; and a collection of ancient genomes from Korea, the Ryukyu islands and early cereal farmers in Japan, complementing previously published genomes from East Asia. Challenging the traditional ‘pastoralist hypothesis’
              6–8
              , we show that the common ancestry and primary dispersals of Transeurasian languages can be traced back to the first farmers moving across Northeast Asia from the Early Neolithic onwards, but that this shared heritage has been masked by extensive cultural interaction since the Bronze Age. As well as marking considerable progress in the three individual disciplines, by combining their converging evidence we show that the early spread of Transeurasian speakers was driven by agriculture.},

	abstract = {Deep learning models with convolutional and recurrent networks are now ubiquitous and analyze massive amounts of audio, image, video, text and graph data, with applications in automatic translation, speech-to-text, scene understanding, ranking user preferences, ad placement, etc. Competing frameworks for building these networks such as TensorFlow, Chainer, CNTK, Torch/PyTorch, Caffe1/2, MXNet and Theano, explore different tradeoffs between usability and expressiveness, research or production orientation and supported hardware. They operate on a DAG of computational operators, wrapping high-performance libraries such as CUDNN (for NVIDIA GPUs) or NNPACK (for various CPUs), and automate memory allocation, synchronization, distribution. Custom operators are needed where the computation does not fit existing high-performance library calls, usually at a high engineering cost. This is frequently required when new operators are invented by researchers: such operators suffer a severe performance penalty, which limits the pace of innovation. Furthermore, even if there is an existing runtime call these frameworks can use, it often doesn't offer optimal performance for a user's particular network architecture and dataset, missing optimizations between operators as well as optimizations that can be done knowing the size and shape of data. Our contributions include (1) a language close to the mathematics of deep learning called Tensor Comprehensions, (2) a polyhedral Just-In-Time compiler to convert a mathematical description of a deep learning DAG into a CUDA kernel with delegated memory management and synchronization, also providing optimizations such as operator fusion and specialization for specific sizes, (3) a compilation cache populated by an autotuner.

The two dominant software models for these devices are NVIDIA’s CUDA and the cross-platform OpenCL standard. Until now, there has not been a fully open-source compiler targeting the CUDA environment, hampering general compiler and architecture research and making deployment difficult in datacenter or supercomputer environments. In this paper, we present gpucc, an LLVM-based, fully open-source, CUDA compatible compiler for high performance computing. It performs various general and CUDA-specific optimizations to generate high performance code. The Clang-based frontend supports modern language features such as those in C++11 and C++14. Compile time is 8\% faster than NVIDIA’s toolchain (nvcc) and it reduces compile time by up to 2.4x for pathological compilations ({\textgreater}100 secs), which tend to dominate build times in parallel build environments. Compared to nvcc, gpucc’s runtime performance is on par for several open-source benchmarks, such as Rodinia (0.8\% faster), SHOC (0.5\% slower), or Tensor (3.7\% faster). It outperforms nvcc on internal large-scale end-to-end benchmarks by up to 51.0\%, with a geometric mean of 22.9\%.},

Importantly, the update and storage of the diagonal approximation of Hessian is as efficient as adaptive first-order optimization methods with linear complexity for both time and memory. To handle nonconvexity, we replace the Hessian with its rectified absolute value, which is guaranteed to be positive-definite. Experiments on three tasks of vision and language show that Apollo achieves significant improvements over other stochastic optimization methods, including SGD and variants of Adam, in term of both convergence speed and generalization performance.

	abstract = {There is an increasing need to bring machine learning to a wide diversity of hardware devices. Current frameworks rely on vendor-speciﬁc operator libraries and optimize for a narrow range of server-class GPUs. Deploying workloads to new platforms – such as mobile phones, embedded devices, and accelerators (e.g., FPGAs, ASICs) – requires signiﬁcant manual effort. We propose TVM, a compiler that exposes graph-level and operator-level optimizations to provide performance portability to deep learning workloads across diverse hardware back-ends. TVM solves optimization challenges speciﬁc to deep learning, such as high-level operator fusion, mapping to arbitrary hardware primitives, and memory latency hiding. It also automates optimization of low-level programs to hardware characteristics by employing a novel, learning-based cost modeling method for rapid exploration of code optimizations. Experimental results show that TVM delivers performance across hardware back-ends that are competitive with state-ofthe-art, hand-tuned libraries for low-power CPU, mobile GPU, and server-class GPUs. We also demonstrate TVM’s ability to target new accelerator back-ends, such as the FPGA-based generic deep learning accelerator. The system is open sourced and in production use inside several major companies.},

	abstract = {Current advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have achieved unprecedented impact across research communities and industry. Nevertheless, concerns about trust, safety, interpretability and accountability of AI were raised by influential thinkers. Many have identified the need for well-founded knowledge representation and reasoning to be integrated with deep learning and for sound explainability. Neural-symbolic computing has been an active area of research for many years seeking to bring together robust learning in neural networks with reasoning and explainability via symbolic representations for network models. In this paper, we relate recent and early research results in neurosymbolic AI with the objective of identifying the key ingredients of the next wave of AI systems. We focus on research that integrates in a principled way neural network-based learning with symbolic knowledge representation and logical reasoning. The insights provided by 20 years of neural-symbolic computing are shown to shed new light onto the increasingly prominent role of trust, safety, interpretability and accountability of AI. We also identify promising directions and challenges for the next decade of AI research from the perspective of neural-symbolic systems.},

A new layer normalization scheme is proposed to allow a scaling to propagate through attention layers, which helps the model achieve remarkable accuracy in operator learning tasks with unnormalized data. Finally, we present three operator learning experiments, including the viscid Burgers' equation, an interface Darcy flow, and an inverse interface coefficient identification problem. All experiments validate the improvements of the newly proposed simple attention-based operator learner over their softmax-normalized counterparts.},

Such nodes may comprise general purpose CPUs and accelerators (such as, GPU, or Intel Xeon Phi) that provide high performance with suitable energy-consumption characteristics. However, exploiting the available performance of heterogeneous architectures may be challenging. There are various parallel programming frameworks (such as, OpenMP, OpenCL, OpenACC, CUDA) and selecting the one that is suitable for a target context is not straightforward. In this paper, we study empirically the characteristics of OpenMP, OpenACC, OpenCL, and CUDA with respect to programming productivity, performance, and energy. To evaluate the programming productivity we use our homegrown tool CodeStat, which enables us to determine the percentage of code lines required to parallelize the code using a speci c framework. We use our tools MeterPU and x-MeterPU to evaluate the energy consumption and the performance. Experiments are conducted using the industry-standard SPEC benchmark suite and the Rodinia benchmark suite for accelerated computing on heterogeneous systems that combine Intel Xeon E5 Processors with a GPU accelerator or an Intel Xeon Phi co-processor.},

Although this diversity of devices is promising for performance, the array of architectures presents programming challenges. High-level programming strategies have emerged to face these challenges, such as the OpenMP ofﬂoading model and OpenACC. However, the varying levels of support for these standards within vendor-speciﬁc and open-source tools, as well as the lack of performance portability across devices, have prevented the standards from achieving their goals. To address these shortcomings, we present CCAMP, an OpenMP and OpenACC interoperable framework. CCAMP provides two primary facilities: language translation between the two standards and device-speciﬁc directive optimization within each standard. We show that by using the CCAMP framework, programmers can easily transplant non-portable code into new ecosystems for new architectures. Additionally, by using CCAMP’s device-speciﬁc directive optimizations, users can achieve optimized performance across architectures using a single source code.},

These two state-of-the-art query processing paradigms are fundamentally different in terms of system structure and query execution code. Both paradigms were used to build fast systems. However, until today it is not clear which paradigm yields faster query execution, as many implementation-speciﬁc choices obstruct a direct comparison of architectures. In this paper, we experimentally compare the two models by implementing both within the same test system. This allows us to use for both models the same query processing algorithms, the same data structures, and the same parallelization framework to ultimately create an apples-to-apples comparison. We ﬁnd that both are efﬁcient, but have different strengths and weaknesses. Vectorization is better at hiding cache miss latency, whereas data-centric compilation requires fewer CPU instructions, which beneﬁts cacheresident workloads. Besides raw, single-threaded performance, we also investigate SIMD as well as multi-core parallelization and different hardware architectures. Finally, we analyze qualitative differences as a guide for system architects.},

	abstract = {Calculating interactions or correlations between pairs of particles is typically the most time-consuming task in particle simulation or correlation analysis. Straightforward implementations using a double loop over particle pairs have traditionally worked well, especially since compilers usually do a good job of unrolling the inner loop. In order to reach high performance on modern CPU and accelerator architectures, single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) parallelization has become essential. Avoiding memory bottlenecks is also increasingly important and requires reducing the ratio of memory to arithmetic operations. Moreover, when pairs only interact within a certain cut-off distance, good SIMD utilization can only be achieved by reordering input and output data, which quickly becomes a limiting factor. Here we present an algorithm for SIMD parallelization based on grouping a fixed number of particles, e.g. 2, 4, or 8, into spatial clusters. Calculating all interactions between particles in a pair of such clusters improves data reuse compared to the traditional scheme and results in a more efficient SIMD parallelization. Adjusting the cluster size allows the algorithm to map to SIMD units of various widths. This flexibility not only enables fast and efficient implementation on current CPUs and accelerator architectures like GPUs or Intel MIC, but it also makes the algorithm future-proof. We present the algorithm with an application to molecular dynamics simulations, where we can also make use of the effective buffering the method introduces.},

This integration is available through either a file-based interface (FBI) or an application programming interface (API). Since QUICK is an open-source GPU-accelerated code with multi-GPU parallelization, users can take advantage of “free of charge” GPU-acceleration in their QM/MM simulations. In this work, we discuss implementation details and give usage examples. We also investigate energy conservation in typical QM/MM simulations performed at the microcanonical ensemble. Finally, benchmark results for two representative systems in bulk water, the N-methylacetamide (NMA) molecule and the photoactive yellow protein (PYP), show the performance of QM/MM simulations with QUICK and AMBER using a varying number of CPU cores and GPUs. Our results highlight the acceleration obtained from a single or multiple GPUs; we observed speedups of up to 53× between a single GPU vs a single CPU core and of up to 2.6× when comparing four GPUs to a single GPU. Results also reveal speedups of up to 3.5× when the API is used instead of FBI.},

	abstract = {In a recent paper, we presented a linear scaling Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) code based on Daubechies wavelets, where a minimal set of localized support functions are optimized in situ and therefore adapted to the chemical properties of the molecular system. Thanks to the systematically controllable accuracy of the underlying basis set, this approach is able to provide an optimal contracted basis for a given system: accuracies for ground state energies and atomic forces are of the same quality as an uncontracted, cubic scaling approach. This basis set offers, by construction, a natural subset where the density matrix of the system can be projected. In this paper, we demonstrate the flexibility of this minimal basis formalism in providing a basis set that can be reused as-is, i.e., without reoptimization, for charge-constrained DFT calculations within a fragment approach. Support functions, represented in the underlying wavelet grid, of the template fragments are roto-translated with high numerical precision to the required positions and used as projectors for the charge weight function. We demonstrate the interest of this approach to express highly precise and efficient calculations for preparing diabatic states and for the computational setup of systems in complex environments.},

This project led to the creation of the BigDFT code, which employs a computational approach with optimal features of flexibility, performance, and precision of the results. In particular, the employed formalism has enabled the implementation of an algorithm able to tackle DFT calculations of large systems, up to many thousands of atoms, with a computational effort that scales linearly with the number of atoms. In this work, we recall some of the features that have been made possible by the peculiar properties of Daubechies wavelets. In particular, we focus our attention on the usage of DFT for large-scale systems. We show how the localized description of the KS problem, emerging from the features of the basis set, is helpful in providing a simplified description of large-scale electronic structure calculations. We provide some examples on how such a simplified description can be employed, and we consider, among the case-studies, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.},

	abstract = {We give a fairly comprehensive review of wavelets and of their application to density-functional theory (DFT) and to our recent application of a wavelet-based version of linear-response time-dependent DFT (LR-TD-DFT). Our intended audience is quantum chemists and theoretical solid-state and chemical physicists. Wavelets are a Fourier-transform-like approach which developed primarily in the latter half of the last century and which was rapidly adapted by engineers in the 1990s because of its advantages compared to standard Fourier transform techniques for multiresolution problems with complicated boundary conditions. High performance computing wavelet codes now also exist for DFT applications in quantum chemistry and solid-state physics, notably the BigDFT code described in this chapter. After briefly describing the basic equations of DFT and LR-TD-DFT, we discuss how they are solved in BigDFT and present new results on the small test molecule carbon monoxide to show how BigDFT results compare against those obtained with the quantum chemistry gaussian-type orbital (GTO) based code deMon2k. In general, the two programs give essentially the same orbital energies, but the wavelet basis of BigDFT converges to the basis set limit much more rapidly than does the GTO basis set of deMon2k. Wavelet-based LR-TD-DFT is still in its infancy, but our calculations confirm the feasibility of implementing LR-TD-DFT in a wavelet-based code.},

We show that the spillage can describe the convergency of the total energy very well and the cutoff radii of the atomic orbitals are extremely important for the quality of the atomic orbitals.

In the near-term, however, the beneﬁts of quantum machine learning are not so clear. Understanding expressibility and trainability of quantum models—and quantum neural networks in particular—requires further investigation. In this work, we use tools from information geometry to deﬁne a notion of expressibility for quantum and classical models. The eﬀective dimension, which depends on the Fisher information, is used to prove a novel generalisation bound and establish a robust measure of expressibility. We show that quantum neural networks are able to achieve a signiﬁcantly better eﬀective dimension than comparable classical neural networks. To then assess the trainability of quantum models, we connect the Fisher information spectrum to barren plateaus, the problem of vanishing gradients. Importantly, certain quantum neural networks can show resilience to this phenomenon and train faster than classical models due to their favourable optimisation landscapes, captured by a more evenly spread Fisher information spectrum. Our work is the ﬁrst to demonstrate that well-designed quantum neural networks oﬀer an advantage over classical neural networks through a higher eﬀective dimension and faster training ability, which we verify on real quantum hardware.},

            A controversy surrounding the “tunnelling time problem” stems from the seeming inability of quantum mechanics to provide, in the usual way, a definition of the duration a particle is supposed to spend in a given region of space. For this reason, the problem is often approached from an “operational” angle. Typically, one tries to mimic, in a quantum case, an experiment which yields the desired result for a classical particle. One such approach is based on the use of a Larmor clock. We show that the difficulty with applying a non-perturbing Larmor clock in order to “time” a classically forbidden transition arises from the quantum Uncertainty Principle. We also demonstrate that for this reason a Larmor time (in fact, any Larmor time) cannot be interpreted as a physical time interval. We provide a theoretical description of the quantities measured by the clock.},

Recently, it has been demonstrated that current state-of-the-art molecular dynamics (MD) based methods are capable of making highly accurate predictions. Conventional MD-based approaches rely on the first principles of statistical mechanics and assume equilibrium sampling of the phase space. In the current work we demonstrate that accurate absolute binding free energies (ABFE) can also be obtained via theoretically rigorous non-equilibrium approaches. Our investigation of ligands binding to bromodomains and T4 lysozyme reveals that both equilibrium and non-equilibrium approaches converge to the same results. The non-equilibrium approach achieves the same level of accuracy and convergence as an equilibrium free energy perturbation (FEP) method enhanced by Hamiltonian replica exchange. We also compare uni- and bi-directional non-equilibrium approaches and demonstrate that considering the work distributions from both forward and reverse directions provides substantial accuracy gains. In summary, non-equilibrium ABFE calculations are shown to yield reliable and well-converged estimates of protein–ligand binding affinity.},

However, machine learning tasks where data is provided can be considerably different than commonly studied computational tasks. In this work, we show that some problems that are classically hard to compute can be easily predicted by classical machines learning from data. Using rigorous prediction error bounds as a foundation, we develop a methodology for assessing potential quantum advantage in learning tasks. The bounds are tight asymptotically and empirically predictive for a wide range of learning models. These constructions explain numerical results showing that with the help of data, classical machine learning models can be competitive with quantum models even if they are tailored to quantum problems. We then propose a projected quantum model that provides a simple and rigorous quantum speed-up for a learning problem in the fault-tolerant regime. For near-term implementations, we demonstrate a significant prediction advantage over some classical models on engineered data sets designed to demonstrate a maximal quantum advantage in one of the largest numerical tests for gate-based quantum machine learning to date, up to 30 qubits.},

	abstract = {Efficient evaluation of a network architecture drawn from a large search space remains a key challenge in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Vanilla NAS evaluates each architecture by training from scratch, which gives the true performance but is extremely time-consuming. Recently, one-shot NAS substantially reduces the computation cost by training only one supernetwork, a.k.a. supernet, to approximate the performance of every architecture in the search space via weight-sharing. However, the performance estimation can be very inaccurate due to the co-adaption among operations. In this paper, we propose few-shot NAS that uses multiple supernetworks, called sub-supernet, each covering different regions of the search space to alleviate the undesired co-adaption. Compared to one-shot NAS, few-shot NAS improves the accuracy of architecture evaluation with a small increase of evaluation cost. With only up to 7 sub-supernets, few-shot NAS establishes new SoTAs: on ImageNet, it finds models that reach 80.5\% top-1 accuracy at 600 MB FLOPS and 77.5\% top-1 accuracy at 238 MFLOPS; on CIFAR10, it reaches 98.72\% top-1 accuracy without using extra data or transfer learning. In Auto-GAN, few-shot NAS outperforms the previously published results by up to 20\%. Extensive experiments show that few-shot NAS significantly improves various one-shot methods, including 4 gradient-based and 6 search-based methods on 3 different tasks in NasBench-201 and NasBench1-shot-1.},

We devise a monolithic solver to solve the interactions among the three systems of liquid, solid, and membrane. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through an array of rigid-fluid contact simulations dominated by strong surface tension, which enables the faithful modeling of a host of new surface-tension-dominant phenomena including: objects with higher density than water can keep afloat on top of it; 'Cheerios effect' about floating objects that do not normally float attract one another; surface tension weakening effect caused by surface-active constituents.},

Specifically, we construct families of translationally-invariant, nearest-neighbour Hamiltonians on a 2D square lattice of d-level quantum systems (d constant), for which determining whether the system is gapped or gapless is an undecidable problem. This is true even with the promise that each Hamiltonian is either gapped or gapless in the strongest sense: it is promised to either have continuous spectrum above the ground state in the thermodynamic limit, or its spectral gap is lower-bounded by a constant in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, this constant can be taken equal to the local interaction strength of the Hamiltonian.},

The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short circuiting traditional approaches which require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking.

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is an increasingly popular statistical tool for analyzing either measured or calculated data sets. Here, we explore its application to a well-defined physics problem, investigating issues of how the underlying physics is handled by ML, and how self-consistent solutions can be found by limiting the domain in which ML is applied. The particular problem is how to find accurate approximate density functionals for the kinetic energy (KE) of noninteracting electrons. Kernel ridge regression is used to approximate the KE of non-interacting fermions in a one dimensional box as a functional of their density. The properties of different kernels and methods of cross-validation are explored, reproducing the physics faithfully in some cases, but not others. We also address how self-consistency can be achieved with information on only a limited electronic density domain. Accurate constrained optimal densities are found via a modified Euler-Lagrange constrained minimization of the machine-learned total energy, despite the poor quality of its functional derivative. A projected gradient descent algorithm is derived using local principal component analysis. Additionally, a sparse grid representation of the density can be used without degrading the performance of the methods. The implications for machine-learned density functional approximations are discussed. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Machine learning holds the promise of learning the energy functional via examples, bypassing the need to solve the Kohn–Sham equations. This should yield substantial savings in computer time, allowing larger systems and/or longer time-scales to be tackled, but attempts to machine-learn this functional have been limited by the need to find its derivative. The present work overcomes this difficulty by directly learning the density-potential and energy-density maps for test systems and various molecules. We perform the first molecular dynamics simulation with a machine-learned density functional on malonaldehyde and are able to capture the intramolecular proton transfer process.

The compiler allows the development of a system of ordinary differential equations describing a complex vulcanization reaction or single-site olefin polymerization reaction--a task that used to require months--to be done in hours. A specialized common sub-expression elimination and other algebraic optimizations sufficiently simplify the complex machine generated code to allow it to be compiled--eliminating all but 8.0\% of the operations in our largest program and enabling over 60 times faster execution on our largest benchmark codes.

Several DL compilers have been proposed from both industry and academia such as Tensorflow XLA and TVM. Similarly, the DL compilers take the DL models described in different DL frameworks as input, and then generate optimized codes for diverse DL hardware as output. However, none of the existing survey has analyzed the unique design architecture of the DL compilers comprehensively. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive survey of existing DL compilers by dissecting the commonly adopted design in details, with emphasis on the DL oriented multi-level IRs, and frontend/backend optimizations. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive comparison among existing DL compilers from various aspects. In addition, we present detailed analysis on the design of multi-level IRs and illustrate the commonly adopted optimization techniques. Finally, several insights are highlighted as the potential research directions of DL compiler. This is the first survey paper focusing on the design architecture of DL compilers, which we hope can pave the road for future research towards DL compiler.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has made breakthroughs and substantial in many fields due to its powerful automatic representation capabilities. It has been proven that neural architecture design is crucial to the feature representation of data and the final performance. However, the design of the neural architecture heavily relies on the researchers' prior knowledge and experience. And due to the limitations of human' inherent knowledge, it is difficult for people to jump out of their original thinking paradigm and design an optimal model. Therefore, an intuitive idea would be to reduce human intervention as much as possible and let the algorithm automatically design the neural architecture. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is just such a revolutionary algorithm, and the related research work is complicated and rich. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic survey on the NAS is essential. Previously related surveys have begun to classify existing work mainly based on the key components of NAS: search space, search strategy, and evaluation strategy. While this classification method is more intuitive, it is difficult for readers to grasp the challenges and the landmark work involved. Therefore, in this survey, we provide a new perspective: beginning with an overview of the characteristics of the earliest NAS algorithms, summarizing the problems in these early NAS algorithms, and then providing solutions for subsequent related research work. Besides, we conduct a detailed and comprehensive analysis, comparison, and summary of these works. Finally, we provide some possible future research directions.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03268},
	abstract = {We propose Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), a fast and inexpensive approach for automatic model design. In ENAS, a controller learns to discover neural network architectures by searching for an optimal subgraph within a large computational graph. The controller is trained with policy gradient to select a subgraph that maximizes the expected reward on the validation set. Meanwhile the model corresponding to the selected subgraph is trained to minimize a canonical cross entropy loss. Thanks to parameter sharing between child models, ENAS is fast: it delivers strong empirical performances using much fewer GPU-hours than all existing automatic model design approaches, and notably, 1000x less expensive than standard Neural Architecture Search. On the Penn Treebank dataset, ENAS discovers a novel architecture that achieves a test perplexity of 55.8, establishing a new state-of-the-art among all methods without post-training processing. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, ENAS designs novel architectures that achieve a test error of 2.89\%, which is on par with NASNet (Zoph et al., 2018), whose test error is 2.65\%.},

	abstract = {The effort devoted to hand-crafting neural network image classifiers has motivated the use of architecture search to discover them automatically. Although evolutionary algorithms have been repeatedly applied to neural network topologies, the image classifiers thus discovered have remained inferior to human-crafted ones. Here, we evolve an image classifier---AmoebaNet-A---that surpasses hand-designs for the first time. To do this, we modify the tournament selection evolutionary algorithm by introducing an age property to favor the younger genotypes. Matching size, AmoebaNet-A has comparable accuracy to current state-of-the-art ImageNet models discovered with more complex architecture-search methods. Scaled to larger size, AmoebaNet-A sets a new state-of-the-art 83.9\% / 96.6\% top-5 ImageNet accuracy. In a controlled comparison against a well known reinforcement learning algorithm, we give evidence that evolution can obtain results faster with the same hardware, especially at the earlier stages of the search. This is relevant when fewer compute resources are available. Evolution is, thus, a simple method to effectively discover high-quality architectures.},

	title = {Learning {Transferable} {Architectures} for {Scalable} {Image} {Recognition}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07012},
	abstract = {Developing neural network image classification models often requires significant architecture engineering. In this paper, we study a method to learn the model architectures directly on the dataset of interest. As this approach is expensive when the dataset is large, we propose to search for an architectural building block on a small dataset and then transfer the block to a larger dataset. The key contribution of this work is the design of a new search space (the "NASNet search space") which enables transferability. In our experiments, we search for the best convolutional layer (or "cell") on the CIFAR-10 dataset and then apply this cell to the ImageNet dataset by stacking together more copies of this cell, each with their own parameters to design a convolutional architecture, named "NASNet architecture". We also introduce a new regularization technique called ScheduledDropPath that significantly improves generalization in the NASNet models. On CIFAR-10 itself, NASNet achieves 2.4\% error rate, which is state-of-the-art. On ImageNet, NASNet achieves, among the published works, state-of-the-art accuracy of 82.7\% top-1 and 96.2\% top-5 on ImageNet. Our model is 1.2\% better in top-1 accuracy than the best human-invented architectures while having 9 billion fewer FLOPS - a reduction of 28\% in computational demand from the previous state-of-the-art model. When evaluated at different levels of computational cost, accuracies of NASNets exceed those of the state-of-the-art human-designed models. For instance, a small version of NASNet also achieves 74\% top-1 accuracy, which is 3.1\% better than equivalently-sized, state-of-the-art models for mobile platforms. Finally, the learned features by NASNet used with the Faster-RCNN framework surpass state-of-the-art by 4.0\% achieving 43.1\% mAP on the COCO dataset.},

	abstract = {Neural networks are powerful and flexible models that work well for many difficult learning tasks in image, speech and natural language understanding. Despite their success, neural networks are still hard to design. In this paper, we use a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy. Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.65, which is 0.09 percent better and 1.05x faster than the previous state-of-the-art model that used a similar architectural scheme. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines. Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-of-the-art model. The cell can also be transferred to the character language modeling task on PTB and achieves a state-of-the-art perplexity of 1.214.},

The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a challenging set of diverse molecules and materials while exhibiting remarkable data efficiency. NequIP outperforms existing models with up to three orders of magnitude fewer training data, challenging the widely held belief that deep neural networks require massive training sets.

Here, we develop a two-dimensional programmable superconducting quantum processor, {\textbackslash}textit\{Zuchongzhi\}, which is composed of 66 functional qubits in a tunable coupling architecture. To characterize the performance of the whole system, we perform random quantum circuits sampling for benchmarking, up to a system size of 56 qubits and 20 cycles. The computational cost of the classical simulation of this task is estimated to be 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than the previous work on 53-qubit Sycamore processor [Nature {\textbackslash}textbf\{574\}, 505 (2019)]. We estimate that the sampling task finished by {\textbackslash}textit\{Zuchongzhi\} in about 1.2 hours will take the most powerful supercomputer at least 8 years.

However, debates in this area have been hampered by different meanings and uses of the term, “bias.” It is sometimes used as a purely descriptive term, sometimes as a pejorative term, and such variations can promote confusion and hamper discussions about when and how to respond to algorithmic bias. In this paper, we first provide a taxonomy of different types and sources of algorithmic bias, with a focus on their different impacts on the proper functioning of autonomous systems. We then use this taxonomy to distinguish between algorithmic biases that are neutral or unobjectionable, and those that are problematic in some way and require a response. In some cases, there are technological or algorithmic adjustments that developers can use to compensate for problematic bias. In other cases, however, responses require adjustments by the agent, whether human or autonomous system, who uses the results of the algorithm. There is no “one size fits all” solution to algorithmic bias.},

Roughly speaking, this ensures that (almost, and quantifiably) no risk is incurred by joining a statistical database.In this survey, we recall the definition of differential privacy and two basic techniques for achieving it.

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}BACKGROUND{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Improvements in computing power can claim a large share of the credit for many of the things that we take for granted in our modern lives: cellphones that are more powerful than room-sized computers from 25 years ago, internet access for nearly half the world, and drug discoveries enabled by powerful supercomputers. Society has come to rely on computers whose performance increases exponentially over time.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Much of the improvement in computer performance comes from decades of miniaturization of computer components, a trend that was foreseen by the Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman in his 1959 address, “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom,” to the American Physical Society. In 1975, Intel founder Gordon Moore predicted the regularity of this miniaturization trend, now called Moore’s law, which, until recently, doubled the number of transistors on computer chips every 2 years.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Unfortunately, semiconductor miniaturization is running out of steam as a viable way to grow computer performance—there isn’t much more room at the “Bottom.” If growth in computing power stalls, practically all industries will face challenges to their productivity. Nevertheless, opportunities for growth in computing performance will still be available, especially at the “Top” of the computing-technology stack: software, algorithms, and hardware architecture.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}ADVANCES{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Software can be made more efficient by performance engineering: restructuring software to make it run faster. Performance engineering can remove inefficiencies in programs, known as software bloat, arising from traditional software-development strategies that aim to minimize an application’s development time rather than the time it takes to run. Performance engineering can also tailor software to the hardware on which it runs, for example, to take advantage of parallel processors and vector units.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Algorithms offer more-efficient ways to solve problems. Indeed, since the late 1970s, the time to solve the maximum-flow problem improved nearly as much from algorithmic advances as from hardware speedups. But progress on a given algorithmic problem occurs unevenly and sporadically and must ultimately face diminishing returns. As such, we see the biggest benefits coming from algorithms for new problem domains (e.g., machine learning) and from developing new theoretical machine models that better reflect emerging hardware.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Hardware architectures can be streamlined—for instance, through processor simplification, where a complex processing core is replaced with a simpler core that requires fewer transistors. The freed-up transistor budget can then be redeployed in other ways—for example, by increasing the number of processor cores running in parallel, which can lead to large efficiency gains for problems that can exploit parallelism. Another form of streamlining is domain specialization, where hardware is customized for a particular application domain. This type of specialization jettisons processor functionality that is not needed for the domain. It can also allow more customization to the specific characteristics of the domain, for instance, by decreasing floating-point precision for machine-learning applications.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In the post-Moore era, performance improvements from software, algorithms, and hardware architecture will increasingly require concurrent changes across other levels of the stack. These changes will be easier to implement, from engineering-management and economic points of view, if they occur within big system components: reusable software with typically more than a million lines of code or hardware of comparable complexity. When a single organization or company controls a big component, modularity can be more easily reengineered to obtain performance gains. Moreover, costs and benefits can be pooled so that important but costly changes in one part of the big component can be justified by benefits elsewhere in the same component.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}OUTLOOK{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}As miniaturization wanes, the silicon-fabrication improvements at the Bottom will no longer provide the predictable, broad-based gains in computer performance that society has enjoyed for more than 50 years. Software performance engineering, development of algorithms, and hardware streamlining at the Top can continue to make computer applications faster in the post-Moore era. Unlike the historical gains at the Bottom, however, gains at the Top will be opportunistic, uneven, and sporadic. Moreover, they will be subject to diminishing returns as specific computations become better explored.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Traditional FPMD approaches have typically been limited to a few thousand atoms at most, due to O(N 3) or worse solver complexity and the large amount of communication required for highly parallel implementations. Attempts to lower the complexity have often introduced uncontrolled approximations or systematic errors. Using a robust new algorithm, we have developed an O(N ) complexity solver for electronic structure problems with fully controllable numerical error. Its minimal use of global communications yields excellent scalability, allowing for very accurate FPMD simulations of more than a million atoms on over a million cores. At these scales, this approach provides multiple orders of magnitude speedup compared to the standard plane-wave approach typically used in condensed matter applications, without sacriﬁcing accuracy. This will open up entire new classes of FPMD simulations, e.g. dilute aqueous solutions.},

	abstract = {The central challenge in building a quantum computer is error correction. Unlike classical bits, which are susceptible to only one type of error, quantum bits (qubits) are susceptible to two types of error, corresponding to flips of the qubit state about the X and Z directions. Although the Heisenberg uncertainty principle precludes simultaneous monitoring of X- and Z-flips on a single qubit, it is possible to encode quantum information in large arrays of entangled qubits that enable accurate monitoring of all errors in the system, provided that the error rate is low1. Another crucial requirement is that errors cannot be correlated. Here we characterize a superconducting multiqubit circuit and find that charge noise in the chip is highly correlated on a length scale over 600 micrometres; moreover, discrete charge jumps are accompanied by a strong transient reduction of qubit energy relaxation time across the millimetre-scale chip. The resulting correlated errors are explained in terms of the charging event and phonon-mediated quasiparticle generation associated with absorption of γ-rays and cosmic-ray muons in the qubit substrate. Robust quantum error correction will require the development of mitigation strategies to protect multiqubit arrays from correlated errors due to particle impacts.},

	abstract = {Fueled by breakthrough technology developments, the biological, biomedical, and behavioral sciences are now collecting more data than ever before. There is a critical need for time- and cost-efficient strategies to analyze and interpret these data to advance human health. The recent rise of machine learning as a powerful technique to integrate multimodality, multifidelity data, and reveal correlations between intertwined phenomena presents a special opportunity in this regard. However, machine learning alone ignores the fundamental laws of physics and can result in ill-posed problems or non-physical solutions. Multiscale modeling is a successful strategy to integrate multiscale, multiphysics data and uncover mechanisms that explain the emergence of function. However, multiscale modeling alone often fails to efficiently combine large datasets from different sources and different levels of resolution. Here we demonstrate that machine learning and multiscale modeling can naturally complement each other to create robust predictive models that integrate the underlying physics to manage ill-posed problems and explore massive design spaces. We review the current literature, highlight applications and opportunities, address open questions, and discuss potential challenges and limitations in four overarching topical areas: ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, data-driven approaches, and theory-driven approaches. Towards these goals, we leverage expertise in applied mathematics, computer science, computational biology, biophysics, biomechanics, engineering mechanics, experimentation, and medicine. Our multidisciplinary perspective suggests that integrating machine learning and multiscale modeling can provide new insights into disease mechanisms, help identify new targets and treatment strategies, and inform decision making for the benefit of human health.},

Most optimizations for uniprocessors reduce the number of instructions executed by the program using transformations based on the analysis of scalar quantities and data-flow techniques. In contrast, optimizations for high-performance superscalar, vector, and parallel processors maximize parallelism and memory locality with transformations that rely on tracking the properties of arrays using loop dependence analysis.
            This survey is a comprehensive overview of the important high-level program restructuring techniques for imperative languages, such as C and Fortran. Transformations for both sequential and various types of parallel architectures are covered in depth. We describe the purpose of each transformation, explain how to determine if it is legal, and give an example of its application.
            Programmers wishing to enhance the performance of their code can use this survey to improve their understanding of the optimizations that compilers can perform, or as a reference for techniques to be applied manually. Students can obtain an overview of optimizing compiler technology. Compiler writers can use this survey as a reference for most of the important optimizations developed to date, and as bibliographic reference for the details of each optimization.

Here we enable the direct construction of flexible molecular force fields from high-level ab initio calculations by incorporating spatial and temporal physical symmetries into a gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) model in an automatic data-driven way. The developed sGDML approach faithfully reproduces global force fields at quantum-chemical CCSD(T) level of accuracy and allows converged molecular dynamics simulations with fully quantized electrons and nuclei. We present MD simulations, for flexible molecules with up to a few dozen atoms and provide insights into the dynamical behavior of these molecules.

	abstract = {Bots are social media accounts that automate interaction with other users, and they are active on the StrongerIn-Brexit conversation happening over Twitter. These automated scripts generate content through these platforms and then interact with people. Political bots are automated accounts that are particularly active on public policy issues, elections, and political crises. In this preliminary study on the use of political bots during the UK referendum on EU membership, we analyze the tweeting patterns for both human users and bots. We find that political bots have a small but strategic role in the referendum conversations: (1) the family of hashtags associated with the argument for leaving the EU dominates, (2) different perspectives on the issue utilize different levels of automation, and (3) less than 1 percent of sampled accounts generate almost a third of all the messages.},

And finally, they were targeted with suitable ads and news to achieve desirable results. Findings/Application: Use of Internet is increasing day-by-day and so is our Digital Footprints. Companies like Netflix started using these data to understand their Customers’ behaviour and to improve their Customer Oriented Marketing Strategies. It has been observed that activities on Social Media say a lot about the users and sometimes it is used by companies harvesting user data in unethical ways.

We also present examples of new models, such as the flow-based random feature model, and new algorithms, such as the smoothed particle method and spectral method, that arise naturally from this continuous formulation. We discuss how the issues of generalization error and implicit regularization can be studied under this framework.},

	abstract = {We study a stochastic game framework with dynamic set of players, for modeling and analyzing their computational investment strategies in distributed computing. Players obtain a certain reward for solving the problem or for providing their computational resources, while incur a certain cost based on the invested time and computational power. We first study a scenario where the reward is offered for solving the problem, such as in blockchain mining. We show that, in Markov perfect equilibrium, players with cost parameters exceeding a certain threshold, do not invest; while those with cost parameters less than this threshold, invest maximal power. Here, players need not know the system state. We then consider a scenario where the reward is offered for contributing to the computational power of a common central entity, such as in volunteer computing. Here, in Markov perfect equilibrium, only players with cost parameters in a relatively low range in a given state, invest. For the case where players are homogeneous, they invest proportionally to the 'reward to cost' ratio. For both the scenarios, we study the effects of players' arrival and departure rates on their utilities using simulations and provide additional insights.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the increasing shift to multicore computers, recent work has developed language support for responsive parallel applications that mix compute-intensive tasks with latency-sensitive, usually interactive, tasks. These developments include calculi that allow assigning priorities to threads, type systems that can rule out priority inversions, and accompanying cost models for predicting responsiveness. These advances share one important limitation: all of this work assumes purely functional programming. This is a significant restriction, because many realistic interactive applications, from games to robots to web servers, use mutable state, e.g., for communication between threads. In this paper, we lift the restriction concerning the use of state. We present λi4, a calculus with implicit parallelism in the form of prioritized futures and mutable state in the form of references. Because both futures and references are firstclass values, λi4 programs can exhibit complex dependencies, including interaction between threads and with the external world (users, network, etc). To reason about the responsiveness of λi4 programs, we extend traditional graph-based cost models for parallelism to account for dependencies created via mutable state, and we present a type system to outlaw priority inversions that can lead to unbounded blocking. We show that these techniques are practical by implementing them in C++ and present an empirical evaluation.},

	abstract = {Inactivated vaccines have been used for over a century to induce protection against viral pathogens. This established approach of vaccine production is relatively straightforward to achieve and there is an augmented safety profile as compared to their live counterparts. Today, there are six viral pathogens for which licensed inactivated vaccines are available with many more in development. Here, we describe the principles of viral inactivation and the application of these principles to vaccine development. Specifically emphasized are the manufacturing procedure and the accompanying assays, of which assays used for monitoring the inactivation process and preservation of neutralizing epitopes, are pivotal. Novel inactivated vaccines in development and the hurdles they face for licensure are also discussed as well as the (dis)advantages of inactivation over the other vaccine production methodologies.},

Nevertheless, natural products also present challenges for drug discovery, such as technical barriers to screening, isolation, characterization and optimization, which contributed to a decline in their pursuit by the pharmaceutical industry from the 1990s onwards. In recent years, several technological and scientific developments — including improved analytical tools, genome mining and engineering strategies, and microbial culturing advances — are addressing such challenges and opening up new opportunities. Consequently, interest in natural products as drug leads is being revitalized, particularly for tackling antimicrobial resistance.

Amidst recent growing concerns about bioterrorism, smallpox vaccination has resurfaced from the history books to become a topic of major importance. Inoculation with vaccinia virus is highly effective for the prevention of smallpox infection, but it is associated with several known side effects that range from mild and self-limited to severe and life-threatening. As the United States moves forward with plans to vaccinate selected health care workers and the military, and perhaps offer the vaccination to all citizens in the future, it is important to fully understand and appreciate the history, risks, and benefits of smallpox vaccination.},

	shorttitle = {Computational {Propaganda}},
	abstract = {Social media platforms do not just circulate political ideas, they support manipulative disinformation campaigns. While some of these disinformation campaigns are carried out directly by individuals, most are waged by software, commonly known as bots, programmed to perform simple, repetitive, robotic tasks. Some social media bots collect and distribute legitimate information, while others communicate with and harass people, manipulate trending algorithms, and inundate systems with spam. Campaigns made up of bots, fake accounts, and trolls can be coordinated by one person, or a small group of people, to give the illusion of large-scale consensus. Some political regimes use political bots to silence opponents and to push official state messaging, to sway the vote during elections, and to defame critics, human rights defenders, civil society groups, and journalists. This book argues that such automation and platform manipulation, amounts to a new political communications mechanism that Samuel Woolley and Philip N. Noward call "computational propaganda." This differs from older styles of propaganda in that it uses algorithms, automation, and human curation to purposefully distribute misleading information over social media networks while it actively learns from and mimicks real people so as to manipulate public opinion across a diverse range of platforms and device networks. This book includes cases of computational propaganda from nine countries (both democratic and authoritarian) and four continents (North and South America, Europe, and Asia), covering propaganda efforts over a wide array of social media platforms and usage in different types of political processes (elections, referenda, and during political crises).},

We identified five distinctive patterns of neutralising antibody dynamics as follows: negative, individuals who did not, at our intervals of sampling, develop neutralising antibodies at the 30\% inhibition level (19 [12\%] of 164 patients); rapid waning, individuals who had varying levels of neutralising antibodies from around 20 days after symptom onset, but seroreverted in less than 180 days (44 [27\%] of 164 patients); slow waning, individuals who remained neutralising antibody-positive at 180 days post-symptom onset (46 [28\%] of 164 patients); persistent, although with varying peak neutralising antibody levels, these individuals had minimal neutralising antibody decay (52 [32\%] of 164 patients); and delayed response, a small group that showed an unexpected increase of neutralising antibodies during late convalescence (at 90 or 180 days after symptom onset; three [2\%] of 164 patients). Persistence of neutralising antibodies was associated with disease severity and sustained level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. By contrast, T-cell responses were similar among the different neutralising antibody dynamics groups. On the basis of the different decay dynamics, we established a prediction algorithm that revealed a wide range of neutralising antibody longevity, varying from around 40 days to many decades.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Neutralising antibody response dynamics in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 vary greatly, and prediction of immune longevity can only be accurately determined at the individual level.

	abstract = {New protein parameters are reported for the all-atom empirical energy function in the CHARMM program. The parameter evaluation was based on a self-consistent approach designed to achieve a balance between the internal (bonding) and interaction (nonbonding) terms of the force field and among the solvent−solvent, solvent−solute, and solute−solute interactions. Optimization of the internal parameters used experimental gas-phase geometries, vibrational spectra, and torsional energy surfaces supplemented with ab initio results. The peptide backbone bonding parameters were optimized with respect to data for N-methylacetamide and the alanine dipeptide. The interaction parameters, particularly the atomic charges, were determined by fitting ab initio interaction energies and geometries of complexes between water and model compounds that represented the backbone and the various side chains. In addition, dipole moments, experimental heats and free energies of vaporization, solvation and sublimation, molecular volumes, and crystal pressures and structures were used in the optimization. The resulting protein parameters were tested by applying them to noncyclic tripeptide crystals, cyclic peptide crystals, and the proteins crambin, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and carbonmonoxy myoglobin in vacuo and in crystals. A detailed analysis of the relationship between the alanine dipeptide potential energy surface and calculated protein φ, χ angles was made and used in optimizing the peptide group torsional parameters. The results demonstrate that use of ab initio structural and energetic data by themselves are not sufficient to obtain an adequate backbone representation for peptides and proteins in solution and in crystals. Extensive comparisons between molecular dynamics simulations and experimental data for polypeptides and proteins were performed for both structural and dynamic properties. Energy minimization and dynamics simulations for crystals demonstrate that the latter are needed to obtain meaningful comparisons with experimental crystal structures. The presented parameters, in combination with the previously published CHARMM all-atom parameters for nucleic acids and lipids, provide a consistent set for condensed-phase simulations of a wide variety of molecules of biological interest.},

These operations correspond to properties of assemblies observed in experiments, and can be shown, analytically and through simulations, to be realizable by generic, randomly connected populations of neurons with Hebbian plasticity and inhibition. Assemblies and their operations constitute a computational model of the brain which we call the Assembly Calculus, occupying a level of detail intermediate between the level of spiking neurons and synapses and that of the whole brain. The resulting computational system can be shown, under assumptions, to be, in principle, capable of carrying out arbitrary computations. We hypothesize that something like it may underlie higher human cognitive functions such as reasoning, planning, and language. In particular, we propose a plausible brain architecture based on assemblies for implementing the syntactic processing of language in cortex, which is consistent with recent experimental results.},

	abstract = {Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)—a blind assessment of the state of the field—AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7. AlphaFold predicts the distances between pairs of residues, is used to construct potentials of mean force that accurately describe the shape of a protein and can be optimized with gradient descent to predict protein structures.},

Using algorithmic advances in employing finite-element discretization for DFT (DFT-FE) in conjunction with efficient computational methodologies and mixed precision strategies, we delay the onset of this cubic scaling by significantly reducing the computational prefactor while increasing the arithmetic intensity and lowering the data movement costs. This has enabled fast, accurate and massively parallel DFT calculations on large-scale metallic systems on both many-core and heterogeneous architectures, with time-to-solution being an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art plane-wave DFT codes. We demonstrate an unprecedented sustained performance of 46 PFLOPS (27.8\% peak FP64 performance) on a dislocation system in Magnesium containing 105,080 electrons using 3,800 GPU nodes of Summit supercomputer, which is the highest performance to-date among DFT codes.},

	abstract = {Carbon nanotubes are expected to play a significant role in the design and manufacture of many nano-mechanical and nano-electronic devices of future. It is important, therefore, that atomic level elastomechanical response properties of both single and multiwall nanotubes be investigated in detail. Classical molecular dynamics simulations employing Brenner's reactive potential with long range van der Waals interactions have been used in mechanistic response studies of carbon nanotubes to external strains. The studies of single and multiwalled carbon nanotubes under compressive strains show the instabilities beyond elastic response. Due to inclusion of non-bonded long range interactions, the simulations also show the redistribution of strain and strain energy from sideways bucklng to the formation of highly localized strained kink sites. Bond rearrangements occur at the kink sites, leading to formation of topological defects, preventing the tube from relaxing fully back to it's original configuration. Elastomechanic response behavior of single and multiwall carbon nanotubes to externally applied compressive strains is simulated and studied in detail. We will describe the results and discuss their implication towards the stability of any molecular mechanical structure made of carbon nanotubes.},

The resulting weak-scaling parallel efficiency was 0.984 on 786,432 IBM Blue Gene/Q cores for a 50.3 million-atom (39.8 trillion degrees-of-freedom) system. The time-to-solution was 60-times less than the previous state-of-the-art, owing to enhanced strong scaling by hierarchical band-spacedomain decomposition and high floating-point performance (50.5\% of the peak). Production simulation involving 16,661 atoms for 21,140 time steps (or 129,208 self-consistent-field iterations) revealed a novel nanostructural design for on-demand hydrogen production from water, advancing renewable energy technologies.

In this work, we take up the idea of the submatrix method and apply it to the DFT computations in the software package CP2K. For that purpose, we transform the underlying numeric operations on distributed, large, sparse matrices into computations on local, much smaller and nearly dense matrices. This allows us to exploit the full floating-point performance of modern CPUs and to make use of dedicated accelerator hardware, where performance has been limited by memory bandwidth before. We demonstrate both functionality and performance of our implementation and show how it can be accelerated with GPUs and FPGAs.},

We have also developed numerical techniques that maintain high accuracy while using single precision computation in order to exploit processor-level vector instructions. These methods are embodied in a newly developed MD code called Desmond that achieves unprecedented simulation throughput and parallel scalability on commodity clusters. Our results suggest that Desmond's parallel performance substantially surpasses that of any previously described code. For example, on a standard benchmark, Desmond's performance on a conventional Opteron cluster with 2K processors slightly exceeded the reported performance of IBM's Blue Gene/L machine with 32K processors running its Blue Matter MD code.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are playing an increasingly important role in several research areas. The most frequently used potentials in MD simulations are pair-wise potentials. Due to the memory wall, computing pair-wise potentials on many-core processors are usually memory bounded. In this paper, we take the SW26010 processor as an exemplary platform to explore the possibility to break the memory bottleneck by improving data reusage via cell-list-based methods. We use cell-lists instead of neighbor-lists in the potential computation, and apply a number of novel optimization methods. Theses methods include: an adaptive replica arrangement strategy, a parameter-profile data structure, and a particle-cell cutoff checking filter. An incremental cell-list building method is also realized to accelerate the construction of cell-lists. Furthermore, we have established an open source standalone framework, ESMD, featuring the techniques above. Experiments show that ESMD is 50{\textasciitilde}170\% faster than previous ports on a single node, and can scale to 1,024 nodes with a weak scalibility of 95\%.},

Previous work, however, has consisted of either proof-of-concept implementations of components, usually the range-limited force; full systems, but with much of the work shared by the host CPU; or prototype demonstrations, e.g., using OpenCL, that neither implement a whole system nor have competitive performance. In this paper, we present what we believe to be the first full-scale FPGA-based simulation engine, and show that its performance is competitive with a GPU (running Amber in an industrial production environment). The system features on-chip particle data storage and management, short- and long-range force evaluation, as well as bonded forces, motion update, and particle migration. Other contributions of this work include exploring numerous architectural trade-offs and analysis of various mappings schemes among particles/cells and the various on-chip compute units. The potential impact is that this system promises to be the basis for long timescale Molecular Dynamics with a commodity cluster.},

	abstract = {Many architects believe that major improvements in cost-energy-performance must now come from domain-specific hardware. This paper evaluates a custom ASIC---called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) --- deployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95\% of our datacenters' NN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is on average about 15X -- 30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with TOPS/Watt about 30X -- 80X higher. Moreover, using the CPU's GDDR5 memory in the TPU would triple achieved TOPS and raise TOPS/Watt to nearly 70X the GPU and 200X the CPU.},

However, most AIMD applications are limited by computational cost to systems with thousands of atoms at most. We report that a machine learningbased simulation protocol (Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics), while retaining ab initio accuracy, can simulate more than 1 nanosecond-long trajectory of over 100 million atoms per day, using a highly optimized code (GPU DeePMD-kit) on the Summit supercomputer. Our code can efﬁciently scale up to the entire Summit supercomputer, attaining 91 PFLOPS in double precision (45.5\% of the peak) and 162/275 PFLOPS in mixed-single/half precision. The great accomplishment of this work is that it opens the door to simulating unprecedented size and time scales with ab initio accuracy.

	abstract = {Ligand docking is a widely used tool for lead discovery and binding mode prediction based drug discovery. The greatest challenges in docking occur when the receptor significantly reorganizes upon small molecule binding, thereby requiring an induced fit docking (IFD) approach in which the receptor is allowed to move in order to bind to the ligand optimally. IFD methods have had some success but suffer from a lack of reliability. Complementing IFD with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) is a straightforward solution in principle but not in practice due to the severe time scale limitations of MD. Here we introduce a metadynamics plus IFD strategy for accurate and reliable prediction of the structures of protein–ligand complexes at a practically useful computational cost. Our strategy allows treating this problem in full atomistic detail and in a computationally efficient manner and enhances the predictive power of IFD methods. We significantly increase the accuracy of the underlying IFD protocol across a large data set comprising 42 different ligand–receptor systems. We expect this approach to be of significant value in computationally driven drug design.},

Here we extend our previous phase 1/2 trial report2 and present BNT162b2 prime/boost induced immune response data from a second phase 1/2 trial in healthy adults (18-55 years of age). BNT162b2 elicited strong antibody responses, with SARS-CoV-2 serum 50\% neutralizing geometric mean titers up to 3.3-fold above those observed in COVID-19 human convalescent samples (HCS) one week post-boost. BNT162b2-elicited sera neutralized 22 pseudoviruses bearing SARS-CoV-2 S variants. Most participants had a strong IFNγ- or IL-2-positive CD8+ and CD4+ T helper type 1 (TH1) T cell response, detectable throughout the full observation period of nine weeks following the boost. pMHC multimer technology identified several BNT162b2-induced epitopes that were presented by frequent MHC alleles and conserved in mutant strains. One week post-boost, epitope-specific CD8+ T cells of the early differentiated effector-memory phenotype comprised 0.02-2.92\% of total circulating CD8+ T cells and were detectable (0.01-0.28\%) eight weeks later. In summary, BNT162b2 elicits an adaptive humoral and poly-specific cellular immune response against epitopes conserved in a broad range of variants at well tolerated doses.},

ImpFlows build on residual flows (ResFlows) with a proper balance between expressiveness and tractability. Through theoretical analysis, we show that the function space of ImpFlow is strictly richer than that of ResFlows. Furthermore, for any ResFlow with a fixed number of blocks, there exists some function that ResFlow has a non-negligible approximation error. However, the function is exactly representable by a single-block ImpFlow. We propose a scalable algorithm to train and draw samples from ImpFlows. Empirically, we evaluate ImpFlow on several classification and density modeling tasks, and ImpFlow outperforms ResFlow with a comparable amount of parameters on all the benchmarks.},

We introduce functional variational Bayesian neural networks (fBNNs), which maximize an Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO) defined directly on stochastic processes, i.e. distributions over functions. We prove that the KL divergence between stochastic processes equals the supremum of marginal KL divergences over all finite sets of inputs. Based on this, we introduce a practical training objective which approximates the functional ELBO using finite measurement sets and the spectral Stein gradient estimator. With fBNNs, we can specify priors entailing rich structures, including Gaussian processes and implicit stochastic processes. Empirically, we find fBNNs extrapolate well using various structured priors, provide reliable uncertainty estimates, and scale to large datasets.},

	abstract = {It has long been known that a single-layer fully-connected neural network with an i.i.d. prior over its parameters is equivalent to a Gaussian process (GP), in the limit of infinite network width. This correspondence enables exact Bayesian inference for infinite width neural networks on regression tasks by means of evaluating the corresponding GP. Recently, kernel functions which mimic multi-layer random neural networks have been developed, but only outside of a Bayesian framework. As such, previous work has not identified that these kernels can be used as covariance functions for GPs and allow fully Bayesian prediction with a deep neural network. In this work, we derive the exact equivalence between infinitely wide deep networks and GPs. We further develop a computationally efficient pipeline to compute the covariance function for these GPs. We then use the resulting GPs to perform Bayesian inference for wide deep neural networks on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We observe that trained neural network accuracy approaches that of the corresponding GP with increasing layer width, and that the GP uncertainty is strongly correlated with trained network prediction error. We further find that test performance increases as finite-width trained networks are made wider and more similar to a GP, and thus that GP predictions typically outperform those of finite-width networks. Finally we connect the performance of these GPs to the recent theory of signal propagation in random neural networks.},

	abstract = {Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) are hierarchical generalizations of Gaussian Processes that combine well calibrated uncertainty estimates with the high flexibility of multilayer models. One of the biggest challenges with these models is that exact inference is intractable. The current state-of-the-art inference method, Variational Inference (VI), employs a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution. This can be a potentially poor unimodal approximation of the generally multimodal posterior. In this work, we provide evidence for the non-Gaussian nature of the posterior and we apply the Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method to generate samples. To efficiently optimize the hyperparameters, we introduce the Moving Window MCEM algorithm. This results in significantly better predictions at a lower computational cost than its VI counterpart. Thus our method establishes a new state-of-the-art for inference in DGPs.},

	abstract = {A controversy surrounding the “tunnelling time problem” stems from the seeming inability of quantum mechanics to provide, in the usual way, a definition of the duration a particle is supposed to spend in a given region of space. For this reason, the problem is often approached from an “operational” angle. Typically, one tries to mimic, in a quantum case, an experiment which yields the desired result for a classical particle. One such approach is based on the use of a Larmor clock. We show that the difficulty with applying a non-perturbing Larmor clock in order to “time” a classically forbidden transition arises from the quantum Uncertainty Principle. We also demonstrate that for this reason a Larmor time (in fact, any Larmor time) cannot be interpreted as a physical time interval. We provide a theoretical description of the quantities measured by the clock.},

	abstract = {The accurate calculation of the binding free energy for arbitrary ligand–protein pairs is a considerable challenge in computer-aided drug discovery. Recently, it has been demonstrated that current state-of-the-art molecular dynamics (MD) based methods are capable of making highly accurate predictions. Conventional MD-based approaches rely on the first principles of statistical mechanics and assume equilibrium sampling of the phase space. In the current work we demonstrate that accurate absolute binding free energies (ABFE) can also be obtained via theoretically rigorous non-equilibrium approaches. Our investigation of ligands binding to bromodomains and T4 lysozyme reveals that both equilibrium and non-equilibrium approaches converge to the same results. The non-equilibrium approach achieves the same level of accuracy and convergence as an equilibrium free energy perturbation (FEP) method enhanced by Hamiltonian replica exchange. We also compare uni- and bi-directional non-equilibrium approaches and demonstrate that considering the work distributions from both forward and reverse directions provides substantial accuracy gains. In summary, non-equilibrium ABFE calculations are shown to yield reliable and well-converged estimates of protein–ligand binding affinity.},

However, machine learning tasks where data is provided can be considerably different than commonly studied computational tasks. In this work, we show that some problems that are classically hard to compute can be easily predicted by classical machines learning from data. Using rigorous prediction error bounds as a foundation, we develop a methodology for assessing potential quantum advantage in learning tasks. The bounds are tight asymptotically and empirically predictive for a wide range of learning models. These constructions explain numerical results showing that with the help of data, classical machine learning models can be competitive with quantum models even if they are tailored to quantum problems. We then propose a projected quantum model that provides a simple and rigorous quantum speed-up for a learning problem in the fault-tolerant regime. For near-term implementations, we demonstrate a significant prediction advantage over some classical models on engineered data sets designed to demonstrate a maximal quantum advantage in one of the largest numerical tests for gate-based quantum machine learning to date, up to 30 qubits.},

	abstract = {Memory access patterns could leak temporal and spatial information in a sensitive program; therefore, obfuscated memory access patterns are desired from the security perspective. Oblivious RAM (ORAM) has been the favored candidate to eliminate the access pattern leakage through randomly remapping data blocks around the physical memory space. Meanwhile, accessing memory with ORAM protocols results in significant memory bandwidth overhead. For each memory request, after going through the ORAM obfuscation, the main memory needs to service tens of actual memory accesses, and only one real access out of them is useful for the program execution. Besides, to ensure the memory bus access patterns are indistinguishable, extra dummy blocks need to be stored and transmitted, which cause memory space waste and poor performance. In this work, we introduce a new framework, String ORAM, that accelerates the Ring ORAM accesses with Spatial and Temporal optimization schemes. First, we identify that dummy blocks could significantly waste memory space and propose a compact ORAM organization that leverages the real blocks in memory to obfuscate the memory access pattern. Then, we identify the inefficiency of current transaction-based Ring ORAM scheduling on DRAM devices and propose an effective scheduling technique that can overlap the time spent on row buffer misses while ensuring correctness and security. With a minimal modification on the hardware and software, and negligible impact on security, the framework reduces 30.05\% execution time and up to 40\% memory space overhead compared to the state-of-the-art bandwidth-efficient Ring ORAM.},

Various private record linkage (PRL) techniques have been proposed, but there is a lack of translation into practice because no software suite supports the entire PRL lifecycle. This paper addresses this issue with the introduction of the Secure Open Enterprise Master Patient Index (SOEMPI). We show how SOEMPI covers the PRL lifecycle, illustrate the implementation of several PRL protocols, and provide a runtime analysis for the integration of two datasets consisting of 10,000 records. While the PRL process is slower than a non-secure setting, our analysis shows the majority of processes in a PRL protocol require several seconds or less and that SOEMPI completes the process in approximately two minutes, which is a practical amount of time for integration.},

This apparent contradiction to complementarity is made possible by nonclassical correlations stronger than entanglement, called steering. Quantum information recognises steering as an essential resource for a number of tasks but, contrary to entanglement, its role for metrology has so far remained unclear. Here, we formulate the EPR paradox in the framework of quantum metrology, showing that it enables the precise estimation of a local phase shift and of its generating observable. Employing a stricter formulation of quantum complementarity, we derive a criterion based on the quantum Fisher information that detects steering in a larger class of states than well-known uncertainty-based criteria. Our result identifies useful steering for quantum-enhanced precision measurements and allows one to uncover steering of non-Gaussian states in state-of-the-art experiments.},

This Primer covers recent additions to the toolbox of the data-savvy organic chemist. There is a new movement in retrosynthetic logic, predictive models of reactivity and chemistry automata, with considerable recent engagement from contributors in diverse fields. The promise of chemical synthesis in the information age is to improve the quality of the molecules of tomorrow through data-harnessing and automation. This Primer is written for organic chemists and data scientists looking to understand the software, hardware, data sets and tactics that are commonly used as well as the capabilities and limitations of the field. The Primer is split into three main components covering retrosynthetic logic, reaction prediction and automated synthesis. The former of these topics is about distilling the strategy of multistep synthesis to a logic that can be taught to a computer. The section on reaction prediction details modern tools and models for developing reaction conditions, catalysts and even new transformations based on information-rich data sets and statistical tools such as machine learning. Finally, we cover recent advances in the use of liquid handling robotics and autonomous systems that can physically perform experiments in the chemistry laboratory.},

	abstract = {The developments of quantum computing algorithms and experiments for atomic scale simulations have largely focused on quantum chemistry for molecules, while their application in condensed matter systems is scarcely explored. Here we present a quantum algorithm to perform dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) calculations for condensed matter systems on currently available quantum computers, and demonstrate it on two quantum hardware platforms. DMFT is required to properly describe the large class of materials with strongly correlated electrons. The computationally challenging part arises from solving the effective problem of an interacting impurity coupled to a bath, which scales exponentially with system size on conventional computers. An exponential speedup is expected on quantum computers, but the algorithms proposed so far are based on real time evolution of the wavefunction, which requires high-depth circuits and hence very low noise levels in the quantum hardware. Here we propose an alternative approach, which uses the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) method for ground and excited states to obtain the needed quantities as part of an exact diagonalization impurity solver. We present the algorithm for a two site DMFT system, which we benchmark using simulations on conventional computers as well as experiments on superconducting and trapped ion qubits, demonstrating that this method is suitable for running DMFT calculations on currently available quantum hardware.},

	abstract = {Inference is the task of drawing conclusions about unobserved variables given observations of related variables. Applications range from identifying diseases from symptoms to classifying economic regimes from price movements. Unfortunately, performing exact inference is intractable in general. One alternative is variational inference, where a candidate probability distribution is optimized to approximate the posterior distribution over unobserved variables. For good approximations a flexible and highly expressive candidate distribution is desirable. In this work, we propose quantum Born machines as variational distributions over discrete variables. We apply the framework of operator variational inference to achieve this goal. In particular, we adopt two specific realizations: one with an adversarial objective and one based on the kernelized Stein discrepancy. We demonstrate the approach numerically using examples of Bayesian networks, and implement an experiment on an IBM quantum computer. Our techniques enable efficient variational inference with distributions beyond those that are efficiently representable on a classical computer.},

	abstract = {Convolution has been the core ingredient of modern neural networks, triggering the surge of deep learning in vision. In this work, we rethink the inherent principles of standard convolution for vision tasks, specifically spatial-agnostic and channel-specific. Instead, we present a novel atomic operation for deep neural networks by inverting the aforementioned design principles of convolution, coined as involution. We additionally demystify the recent popular self-attention operator and subsume it into our involution family as an over-complicated instantiation. The proposed involution operator could be leveraged as fundamental bricks to build the new generation of neural networks for visual recognition, powering different deep learning models on several prevalent benchmarks, including ImageNet classification, COCO detection and segmentation, together with Cityscapes segmentation. Our involution-based models improve the performance of convolutional baselines using ResNet-50 by up to 1.6\% top-1 accuracy, 2.5\% and 2.4\% bounding box AP, and 4.7\% mean IoU absolutely while compressing the computational cost to 66\%, 65\%, 72\%, and 57\% on the above benchmarks, respectively.

We outline the general steps of topological quantum computation, as well as discuss various challenges faced by it. We also review the literature on condensed matter systems where anyons can emerge. Finally, the appearance of anyons and employing them for quantum computation is demonstrated in the context of a simple microscopic model -- the topological superconducting nanowire -- that describes the low-energy physics of several experimentally relevant settings. This model supports localised Majorana zero modes that are the simplest and the experimentally most tractable types of anyons that are needed to perform topological quantum computation.},

	abstract = {Quantum chemistry is a discipline which relies heavily on very expensive numerical computations. The scaling of correlated wave function methods lies, in their standard implementation, between O(N5) and O(eN), where N is proportional to the system size. Therefore, performing accurate calculations on chemically meaningful systems requires (i) approximations that can lower the computational scaling and (ii) efficient implementations that take advantage of modern massively parallel architectures. Quantum Package is an open-source programming environment for quantum chemistry specially designed for wave function methods. Its main goal is the development of determinant-driven selected configuration interaction (sCI) methods and multireference second-order perturbation theory (PT2). The determinant-driven framework allows the programmer to include any arbitrary set of determinants in the reference space, hence providing greater methodological freedom. The sCI method implemented in Quantum Package is based on the CIPSI (Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection made Iteratively) algorithm which complements the variational sCI energy with a PT2 correction. Additional external plugins have been recently added to perform calculations with multireference coupled cluster theory and range-separated density-functional theory. All the programs are developed with the IRPF90 code generator, which simplifies collaborative work and the development of new features. Quantum Package strives to allow easy implementation and experimentation of new methods, while making parallel computation as simple and efficient as possible on modern supercomputer architectures. Currently, the code enables, routinely, to realize runs on roughly 2 000 CPU cores, with tens of millions of determinants in the reference space. Moreover, we have been able to push up to 12 288 cores in order to test its parallel efficiency. In the present manuscript, we also introduce some key new developments: (i) a renormalized second-order perturbative correction for efficient extrapolation to the full CI limit and (ii) a stochastic version of the CIPSI selection performed simultaneously to the PT2 calculation at no extra cost.},

For two prototypical, challenging molecules, we readily reach the accuracy of the best available reference excitation energies using energy minimization in a state-specific or state-average fashion for states of different or equal symmetry, respectively. On the other hand, in variance minimization, where the use of suitable functionals is expected to target specific states regardless of the symmetry, we encounter severe problems for a variety of wave functions: as the variance converges, the energy drifts away from that of the selected state. This unexpected behavior is sometimes observed even when the target is the ground state and generally prevents the robust estimation of total and excitation energies. We analyze this problem using a very simple wave function and infer that the optimization finds little or no barrier to escape from a local minimum or local plateau, eventually converging to a lower-variance state instead of the target state. For the increasingly complex systems becoming in reach of quantum Monte Carlo simulations, variance minimization with current functionals appears to be an impractical route.},

	abstract = {This report considers the problem of Byzantine fault-tolerance in homogeneous multi-agent distributed learning. In this problem, each agent samples i.i.d. data points, and the goal for the agents is to compute a mathematical model that optimally fits, in expectation, the data points sampled by all the agents. We consider the case when a certain number of agents may be Byzantine faulty. Such faulty agents may not follow a prescribed learning algorithm. Faulty agents may share arbitrary incorrect information regarding their data points to prevent the non-faulty agents from learning a correct model. We propose a fault-tolerance mechanism for the distributed stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD) method -- a standard distributed supervised learning algorithm. Our fault-tolerance mechanism relies on a norm based gradient-filter, named comparative gradient elimination (CGE), that aims to mitigate the detrimental impact of malicious incorrect stochastic gradients shared by the faulty agents by limiting their Euclidean norms. We show that the CGE gradient-filter guarantees fault-tolerance against a bounded number of Byzantine faulty agents if the stochastic gradients computed by the non-faulty agents satisfy the standard assumption of bounded variance. We demonstrate the applicability of the CGE gradient-filer for distributed supervised learning of artificial neural networks. We show that the fault-tolerance by the CGE gradient-filter is comparable to that by other state-of-the-art gradient-filters, namely the multi-KRUM, geometric median of means, and coordinate-wise trimmed mean. Lastly, we propose a gradient averaging scheme that aims to reduce the sensitivity of a supervised learning process to individual agents' data batch-sizes. We show that gradient averaging improves the fault-tolerance property of a gradient-filter, including, but not limited to, the CGE gradient-filter.},

	abstract = {High-throughput DNA sequencing is the mainstay of modern genomics research. A common operation used in bioinformatic analysis for many applications of high-throughput sequencing is the counting and indexing of fixed length substrings of DNA sequences called k-mers. Counting k-mers is often accomplished via hashing, and distributed memory k-mer counting algorithms for large datasets are memory access and network communication bound. In this work, we present two optimized distributed parallel hash table techniques that utilize cache friendly algorithms for local hashing, overlapped communication and computation to hide communication costs, and vectorized hash functions that are specialized for k-mer and other short key indices. On 4096 cores of the NERSC Cori supercomputer, our implementation completed index construction and query on an approximately 1 TB human genome dataset in just 11.8 seconds and 5.8 seconds, demonstrating speedups of 2.06x and 3.7x, respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art distributed memory k-mer counter.},

	abstract = {Large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on supercomputers play an increasingly important role in many research areas. In this paper, we present our efforts on redesigning the widely used LAMMPS MD simulator for Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer and its ShenWei many-core architecture (SW26010). The memory constraints of SW26010 bring a number of new challenges for achieving efficient MD implementation on it. In order to overcome these constraints, we employ four levels of optimization: (1) a hybrid memory update strategy; (2) a software cache strategy; (3) customized transcendental math functions; and (4) a full pipeline acceleration. Furthermore, we redesign the code to enable all possible vectorization. Experiments show that our redesigned software on a single SW26010 processor can outperform over 100 E5-2650 v2 cores for running the latest stable release (11Aug17) of LAMMPS. We also achieve a performance of over 2.43 PFlops for a Tersoff simulation when using 16,384 nodes on Sunway TaihuLight.},

To lengthen the SIMD loop and thus improve SIMD utilization, the approach used in this paper is to batch together multiple integrals that can be computed using the same code path. The standard approach is to compute integrals one at a time, and thus a batching procedure had to be developed. This paper shows proof-of-concept and demonstrates the performance gains possible when the batched approach is used. Batching also enables certain optimizations when the integrals are used to compute the Fock matrix. We further describe several other optimizations that were needed to obtain up to a 270\% speedup over the non-batching version of the code, making a compelling case for adopting the presented techniques in quantum chemistry software.},

We propose ShenTu8, the first general-purpose graph processing framework that can efficiently utilize an entire Petascale system to process multi-trillion edge graphs in seconds. ShenTu embodies four key innovations: hardware specialization, supernode routing, on-chip sorting, and degree-aware messaging, which together enable its unprecedented performance and scalability. It can traverse a record-size 70-trillion-edge graph in seconds. Furthermore, ShenTu enables the processing of a spam detection problem on a 12-trillion edge Internet graph, making it possible to identify trustworthy and spam webpages directly at the fine-grained page level.},

The pairwise contribution is calculated by a function implemented via a neural network that takes the properties of the two atoms and their distance as input. The pairwise function is trained using a portion of the PDBbind 2018 data set. The model achieves good accuracy for affinity predictions when evaluated with PDBbind 2018 and with the CASF-2016 benchmark, comparing favorably to many scoring functions such as that of AutoDock Vina.

	abstract = {Accurately predicting small molecule partitioning and hydrophobicity is critical in the drug discovery process. There are many heterogeneous chemical environments within a cell and entire human body. For example, drugs must be able to cross the hydrophobic cellular membrane to reach their intracellular targets, and hydrophobicity is an important driving force for drug–protein binding. Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are routinely used to calculate free energies of small molecules binding to proteins, crossing lipid membranes, and solvation but are computationally expensive. Machine learning (ML) and empirical methods are also used throughout drug discovery but rely on experimental data, limiting the domain of applicability. We present atomistic MD simulations calculating 15,000 small molecule free energies of transfer from water to cyclohexane. This large data set is used to train ML models that predict the free energies of transfer. We show that a spatial graph neural network model achieves the highest accuracy, followed closely by a 3D-convolutional neural network, and shallow learning based on the chemical fingerprint is significantly less accurate. A mean absolute error of ∼4 kJ/mol compared to the MD calculations was achieved for our best ML model. We also show that including data from the MD simulation improves the predictions, tests the transferability of each model to a diverse set of molecules, and show multitask learning improves the predictions. This work provides insight into the hydrophobicity of small molecules and ML cheminformatics modeling, and our data set will be useful for designing and testing future ML cheminformatics methods.},

The Hamiltonian is similar to the one proposed by Lynch and Pettitt (Lynch and Pettitt, J Chem Phys 1997, 107, 8594), which consists of the kinetic and potential energies for real and fractional particles as well as the kinetic and potential energy terms for material and heat reservoirs interacting with the system. We perform a nonlinear scaling of the potential energy parameters of the fractional particle, as well as its mass to vary the number of particles dynamically. On the basis of the equations of motion derived from this Hamiltonian, an algorithm has been proposed for MD simulation at constant chemical potential. The algorithm has been tested for the ideal gas, for the Lennard–Jones fluid over a wide range of temperatures and densities, and for water. The results for the low-density Lennard–Jones fluid are compared with the predictions from a truncated virial equation of state. In the case of the dense Lennard–Jones fluid and water our predicted results are compared with the results reported using other available methods for the calculation of the chemical potential. The method is also applied to the case of vapor-liquid coexistence point predictions. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem, 2007},

	abstract = {Given access to accurate solutions of the many-electron Schrödinger equation, nearly all chemistry could be derived from first principles. Exact wave functions of interesting chemical systems are out of reach because they are NP-hard to compute in general, but approximations can be found using polynomially scaling algorithms. The key challenge for many of these algorithms is the choice of wave function approximation, or Ansatz, which must trade off between efficiency and accuracy. Neural networks have shown impressive power as accurate practical function approximators and promise as a compact wave-function Ansatz for spin systems, but problems in electronic structure require wave functions that obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. Here we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, the Fermionic neural network, as a powerful wave-function Ansatz for many-electron systems. The Fermionic neural network is able to achieve accuracy beyond other variational quantum Monte Carlo Ansatz on a variety of atoms and small molecules. Using no data other than atomic positions and charges, we predict the dissociation curves of the nitrogen molecule and hydrogen chain, two challenging strongly correlated systems, to significantly higher accuracy than the coupled cluster method, widely considered the most accurate scalable method for quantum chemistry at equilibrium geometry. This demonstrates that deep neural networks can improve the accuracy of variational quantum Monte Carlo to the point where it outperforms other ab initio quantum chemistry methods, opening the possibility of accurate direct optimization of wave functions for previously intractable many-electron systems.},

	abstract = {As more data are introduced in the building of models of chemical reactivity, the mechanistic component can be reduced until ‘big data’ applications are reached. These methods no longer depend on underlying mechanistic hypotheses, potentially learning them implicitly through extensive data training. Reactivity models often focus on reaction barriers, but can also be trained to directly predict lab-relevant properties, such as yields or conditions. Calculations with a quantum-mechanical component are still preferred for quantitative predictions of reactivity. Although big data applications tend to be more qualitative, they have the advantage to be broadly applied to different kinds of reactions. There is a continuum of methods in between these extremes, such as methods that use quantum-derived data or descriptors in machine learning models. Here, we present an overview of the recent machine learning applications in the field of chemical reactivity from a mechanistic perspective. Starting with a summary of how reactivity questions are addressed by quantum-mechanical methods, we discuss methods that augment or replace quantum-based modelling with faster alternatives relying on machine learning.},

Systems theories, including network analysis and machine learning, are well placed for analysing these data but must be applied with an understanding of the relevant biological and computational theories. Through applying these techniques to omics data, systems biology addresses the problems posed by the complex organization of biological processes. In this Review, we describe the techniques and sources of omics data, outline network theory, and highlight exemplars of novel approaches that combine gene regulatory and co-expression networks, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics and phenomics with informatics techniques to provide new insights into cardiovascular disease. The use of systems approaches will become necessary to integrate data from more than one omic technique. Although understanding the interactions between different omics data requires increasingly complex concepts and methods, we argue that hypothesis-driven investigations and independent validation must still accompany these novel systems biology approaches to realize their full potential.},

Although these agents offer new promise to patients with HCC, the optimal choice and sequence of therapies remains unknown and without established biomarkers, and many patients do not respond to treatment. The advances and the decreasing costs of molecular measurement technologies enable profiling of HCC molecular features (such as genome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome) at different levels, including bulk tissues, animal models and single cells. The release of such data sets to the public enhances the ability to search for information from these legacy studies and provides the opportunity to leverage them to understand HCC mechanisms, rationally develop new therapeutics and identify candidate biomarkers of treatment response. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of public data sets related to HCC and discuss how emerging artificial intelligence methods can be applied to identify new targets and drugs as well as to guide therapeutic choices for improved HCC treatment.},

	abstract = {Reaction optimization is fundamental to synthetic chemistry, from optimizing the yield of industrial processes to selecting conditions for the preparation of medicinal candidates1. Likewise, parameter optimization is omnipresent in artificial intelligence, from tuning virtual personal assistants to training social media and product recommendation systems2. Owing to the high cost associated with carrying out experiments, scientists in both areas set numerous (hyper)parameter values by evaluating only a small subset of the possible configurations. Bayesian optimization, an iterative response surface-based global optimization algorithm, has demonstrated exceptional performance in the tuning of machine learning models3. Bayesian optimization has also been recently applied in chemistry4–9; however, its application and assessment for reaction optimization in synthetic chemistry has not been investigated. Here we report the development of a framework for Bayesian reaction optimization and an open-source software tool that allows chemists to easily integrate state-of-the-art optimization algorithms into their everyday laboratory practices. We collect a large benchmark dataset for a palladium-catalysed direct arylation reaction, perform a systematic study of Bayesian optimization compared to human decision-making in reaction optimization, and apply Bayesian optimization to two real-world optimization efforts (Mitsunobu and deoxyfluorination reactions). Benchmarking is accomplished via an online game that links the decisions made by expert chemists and engineers to real experiments run in the laboratory. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian optimization outperforms human decisionmaking in both average optimization efficiency (number of experiments) and consistency (variance of outcome against initially available data). Overall, our studies suggest that adopting Bayesian optimization methods into everyday laboratory practices could facilitate more efficient synthesis of functional chemicals by enabling better-informed, data-driven decisions about which experiments to run.},

Elucidating the behavior of quantum interacting systems of many particles remains one of the biggest challenges in physics. Traditional numerical methods often work well, but some of the most interesting problems leave them stumped. Carleo and Troyer harnessed the power of machine learning to develop a variational approach to the quantum many-body problem (see the Perspective by Hush). The method performed at least as well as state-of-the-art approaches, setting a benchmark for a prototypical two-dimensional problem. With further development, it may well prove a valuable piece in the quantum toolbox.
Science, this issue p. 602; see also p. 580
The challenge posed by the many-body problem in quantum physics originates from the difficulty of describing the nontrivial correlations encoded in the exponential complexity of the many-body wave function. Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to a tractable computational form for some notable cases of physical interest. We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with a variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme we demonstrate is capable of both finding the ground state and describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems. Our approach achieves high accuracy in describing prototypical interacting spins models in one and two dimensions.

In this paper, we present a quantum algorithm for RR, where the technique of parallel Hamiltonian simulation to simulate a number of Hermitian matrices in parallel is proposed and used to develop a quantum version of \$K\$K-fold cross-validation approach, which can efficiently estimate the predictive performance of RR. Our algorithm consists of two phases: (1) using quantum \$K\$K-fold cross-validation to efficiently determine a good αα with which RR can achieve good predictive performance, and then (2) generating a quantum state encoding the optimal fitting parameters of RR with such αα, which can be further utilized to predict new data. Since indefinite dense Hamiltonian simulation has been adopted as a key subroutine, our algorithm can efficiently handle non-sparse data matrices. It is shown that our algorithm can achieve exponential speedup over the classical counterpart for (low-rank) data matrices with low condition numbers. But when the condition numbers of data matrices are large to be amenable to full or approximately full ranks of data matrices, only polynomial speedup can be achieved.},

	abstract = {Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies that each have the potential to alter how computation is performed to address previously untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous in pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being the best known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such classification problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element in the computational speed-ups enabled by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here we propose and experimentally implement two quantum algorithms on a superconducting processor. A key component in both methods is the use of the quantum state space as feature space. The use of a quantum-enhanced feature space that is only efficiently accessible on a quantum computer provides a possible path to quantum advantage. The algorithms solve a problem of supervised learning: the construction of a classifier. One method, the quantum variational classifier, uses a variational quantum circuit1,2 to classify the data in a way similar to the method of conventional SVMs. The other method, a quantum kernel estimator, estimates the kernel function on the quantum computer and optimizes a classical SVM. The two methods provide tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers3 to machine learning.},

Protein structural modeling, such as predicting structure from amino acid sequence and evolutionary information, designing proteins toward desirable functionality, or predicting properties or behavior of a protein, is critical to understand and engineer biological systems at the molecular level. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in applying deep learning techniques to tackle problems in protein structural modeling and design. We dissect the emerging approaches using deep learning techniques for protein structural modeling and discuss advances and challenges that must be addressed. We argue for the central importance of structure, following the “sequence → structure → function” paradigm. This review is directed to help both computational biologists to gain familiarity with the deep learning methods applied in protein modeling, and computer scientists to gain perspective on the biologically meaningful problems that may benefit from deep learning techniques.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic organisms responsible for ∼25\% of organic carbon fixation on the Earth. These bacteria began to convert solar energy and carbon dioxide into bioenergy and oxygen more than two billion years ago. Cyanophages, which infect these bacteria, have an important role in regulating the marine ecosystem by controlling cyanobacteria community organization and mediating lateral gene transfer. Here we visualize the maturation process of cyanophage Syn5 inside its host cell, Synechococcus, using Zernike phase contrast electron cryo-tomography (cryoET). This imaging modality yields dramatic enhancement of image contrast over conventional cryoET and thus facilitates the direct identification of subcellular components, including thylakoid membranes, carboxysomes and polyribosomes, as well as phages, inside the congested cytosol of the infected cell. By correlating the structural features and relative abundance of viral progeny within cells at different stages of infection, we identify distinct Syn5 assembly intermediates. Our results indicate that the procapsid releases scaffolding proteins and expands its volume at an early stage of genome packaging. Later in the assembly process, we detected full particles with a tail either with or without an additional horn. The morphogenetic pathway we describe here is highly conserved and was probably established long before that of double-stranded DNA viruses infecting more complex organisms.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of atomistic physics-based force fields for the simulation of biological macromolecules has typically been benchmarked experimentally using biophysical data from simple, often single-chain systems. In the case of proteins, the careful refinement of force field parameters associated with torsion-angle potentials and the use of improved water models have enabled a great deal of progress toward the highly accurate simulation of such monomeric systems in both folded and, more recently, disordered states. In living organisms, however, proteins constantly interact with other macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, and these interactions are often essential for proper biological function. Here, we show that state-of-the-art force fields tuned to provide an accurate description of both ordered and disordered proteins can be limited in their ability to accurately describe protein–protein complexes. This observation prompted us to perform an extensive reparameterization of one variant of the Amber protein force field. Our objective involved refitting not only the parameters associated with torsion-angle potentials but also the parameters used to model nonbonded interactions, the specification of which is expected to be central to the accurate description of multicomponent systems. The resulting force field, which we call DES-Amber, allows for more accurate simulations of protein–protein complexes, while still providing a state-of-the-art description of both ordered and disordered single-chain proteins. Despite the improvements, calculated protein–protein association free energies still appear to deviate substantially from experiment, a result suggesting that more fundamental changes to the force field, such as the explicit treatment of polarization effects, may simultaneously further improve the modeling of single-chain proteins and protein–protein complexes.},

	abstract = {Motivation Protein contacts contain key information for the understanding of protein structure and function and thus, contact prediction from sequence is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not very useful for de novo structure prediction. Method This paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual neural networks. The first residual network conducts a series of 1-dimensional convolutional transformation of sequential features; the second residual network conducts a series of 2-dimensional convolutional transformation of pairwise information including output of the first residual network, EC information and pairwise potential. By using very deep residual networks, we can accurately model contact occurrence patterns and complex sequence-structure relationship and thus, obtain higher-quality contact prediction regardless of how many sequence homologs are available for proteins in question. Results Our method greatly outperforms existing methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted folding. Tested on 105 CASP11 targets, 76 past CAMEO hard targets, and 398 membrane proteins, the average top L long-range prediction accuracy obtained by our method, one representative EC method CCMpred and the CASP11 winner MetaPSICOV is 0.47, 0.21 and 0.30, respectively; the average top L/10 long-range accuracy of our method, CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 0.77, 0.47 and 0.59, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints but without any force fields can yield correct folds (i.e., TMscore{\textgreater}0.6) for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while that using MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred-predicted contacts can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively. Our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models especially for membrane proteins. The 3D models built from our contact prediction have TMscore{\textgreater}0.5 for 208 of the 398 membrane proteins, while those from homology modeling have TMscore{\textgreater}0.5 for only 10 of them. Further, even if trained mostly by soluble proteins, our deep learning method works very well on membrane proteins. In the recent blind CAMEO benchmark, our fully-automated web server implementing this method successfully folded 6 targets with a new fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs, including one β protein of 182 residues, one α+β protein of 125 residues, one α protein of 140 residues, one α protein of 217 residues, one α/β of 260 residues and one α protein of 462 residues. Our method also achieved the highest F1 score on free-modeling targets in the latest CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction), although it was not fully implemented back then.

RaptorX distinguishes itself from other servers by the quality of the alignment between a target sequence and one or multiple distantly related template proteins (especially those with sparse sequence profiles) and by a novel nonlinear scoring function and a probabilistic-consistency algorithm. Consequently, RaptorX delivers high-quality structural models for many targets with only remote templates. At present, it takes RaptorX ∼35 min to finish processing a sequence of 200 amino acids.

	abstract = {Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems—patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients—and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.},

	abstract = {Applications of quantum walks can depend on the number, exchange symmetry and indistinguishability of the particles involved, and the underlying graph structures where they move. Here, we show that silicon photonics, by exploiting an entanglement-driven scheme, can realize quantum walks with full control over all these properties in one device. The device we realize implements entangled two-photon quantum walks on any five-vertex graph, with continuously tunable particle exchange symmetry and indistinguishability. We show how this simulates single-particle walks on larger graphs, with size and geometry controlled by tuning the properties of the composite quantum walkers. We apply the device to quantum walk algorithms for searching vertices in graphs and testing for graph isomorphisms. In doing so, we implement up to 100 sampled time steps of quantum walk evolution on each of 292 different graphs. This opens the way to large-scale, programmable quantum walk processors for classically intractable applications.
Programmable silicon photonics realizes universal control over quantum walks.

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a valuable tool for characterizing the structural dynamics of folded proteins and should be similarly applicable to disordered proteins and proteins with both folded and disordered regions. It has been unclear, however, whether any physical model (force field) used in MD simulations accurately describes both folded and disordered proteins. Here, we select a benchmark set of 21 systems, including folded and disordered proteins, simulate these systems with six state-of-the-art force fields, and compare the results to over 9,000 available experimental data points. We find that none of the tested force fields simultaneously provided accurate descriptions of folded proteins, of the dimensions of disordered proteins, and of the secondary structure propensities of disordered proteins. Guided by simulation results on a subset of our benchmark, however, we modified parameters of one force field, achieving excellent agreement with experiment for disordered proteins, while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for folded proteins. The resulting force field, a99SB-disp, should thus greatly expand the range of biological systems amenable to MD simulation. A similar approach could be taken to improve other force fields.},

The 1.1 release represents a major update meant to automate complex tasks, such as geometry optimization using complete-basis-set extrapolation or focal-point methods. Conversion of the top-level code to a Python module means that Psi4 can now be used in complex workflows alongside other Python tools. Several new features have been added with the aid of libraries providing easy access to techniques such as density fitting, Cholesky decomposition, and Laplace denominators. The build system has been completely rewritten to simplify interoperability with independent, reusable software components for quantum chemistry. Finally, a wide range of new theoretical methods and analyses have been added to the code base, including functional-group and open-shell symmetry adapted perturbation theory, density-fitted coupled cluster with frozen natural orbitals, orbital-optimized perturbation and coupled-cluster methods (e.g., OO-MP2 and OO-LCCD), density-fitted multiconfigurational self-consistent field, density cumulant functional theory, algebraic-diagrammatic construction excited states, improvements to the geometry optimizer, and the “X2C” approach to relativistic corrections, among many other improvements.},

	abstract = {It is argued that underlying the Church–Turing hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: ‘every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means’. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the 'universal quantum computer’ are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include ‘quantum parallelism’, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett’s. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the ‘complexity’ or ‘knowledge’ in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.},

	abstract = {琉球於明清時期為中國之屬國，然自 1879 年琉球遭日本所併吞後， 中國社會對過去琉球之地位及與中國關係之本質逐漸模糊。時至抗戰爆 發，「收復失地」議題引發討論，琉球遂再度受政治菁英與社會輿論所 關注。

美日開戰後，因應未來戰後和平會議對領土與東亞秩序之討論，國 府最高決策機構—國防最高委員會遂設立國際問題討論會。本文聚焦國 際問題討論會對琉球戰後地位的討論、開羅會議前「琉球條款」之出爐， 以及開羅會議期間「蔣羅會」就琉球歸屬處置的討論。

本研究發現，一、國府內部對琉球戰後地位處理意見紛呈，直至開 羅會議前仍未能達成統一之見解；二、從史料檔案中也發現「琉球條款」 存在兩組四種版本，提案涵蓋包括三類主要意見：「歸隸中國」、「歸 日但需非軍事化」、「由國際機構託管」；三、美國國家檔案有關開羅 會議涉及琉球問題的討論記錄為 1956 年中華民國政府所提供，且琉球部 分經過四次內部修訂包括蔣本人的修改後才定案提交美國。

「蔣羅會」上羅斯福「再三」詢問戰後中國是否有意「收回琉球」， 蔣介石提議「中美共管」。經本文分析，其背景包括一、蔣乃根據「定 案」調整、非無中生有；二、蔣介石對琉球地位的理解，已由「中國之 失地」轉變至「其地位與朝鮮一樣」；三、受「甲午時限」之影響；四、 中國缺乏強大海軍；五、蔣揣測羅未必真心，避免因此損及合作互信。},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0833},
	abstract = {This survey summarizes several results about quantum computing related to (mostly static) data structures. First, we describe classical data structures for the set membership and the predecessor search problems: Perfect Hash tables for set membership by Fredman, Koml{\textbackslash}'\{o\}s and Szemer{\textbackslash}'\{e\}di and a data structure by Beame and Fich for predecessor search. We also prove results about their space complexity (how many bits are required) and time complexity (how many bits have to be read to answer a query). After that, we turn our attention to classical data structures with quantum access. In the quantum access model, data is stored in classical bits, but they can be accessed in a quantum way: We may read several bits in superposition for unit cost. We give proofs for lower bounds in this setting that show that the classical data structures from the first section are, in some sense, asymptotically optimal - even in the quantum model. In fact, these proofs are simpler and give stronger results than previous proofs for the classical model of computation. The lower bound for set membership was proved by Radhakrishnan, Sen and Venkatesh and the result for the predecessor problem by Sen and Venkatesh. Finally, we examine fully quantum data structures. Instead of encoding the data in classical bits, we now encode it in qubits. We allow any unitary operation or measurement in order to answer queries. We describe one data structure by de Wolf for the set membership problem and also a general framework using fully quantum data structures in quantum walks by Jeffery, Kothari and Magniez.},

	abstract = {Direct molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with ab initio quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods is very powerful for studying the mechanism of chemical reactions in a complex environment but also very time-consuming. The computational cost of QM/MM calculations during MD simulations can be reduced significantly using semiempirical QM/MM methods with lower accuracy. To achieve higher accuracy at the ab initio QM/MM level, a correction on the existing semiempirical QM/MM model is an attractive idea. Recently, we reported a neural network (NN) method as QM/MM-NN to predict the potential energy difference between semiempirical and ab initio QM/MM approaches. The high-level results can be obtained using neural network based on semiempirical QM/MM MD simulations, but the lack of direct MD samplings at the ab initio QM/MM level is still a deficiency that limits the applications of QM/MM-NN. In the present paper, we developed a dynamic scheme of QM/MM-NN for direct MD simulations on the NN-predicted potential energy surface to approximate ab initio QM/MM MD. Since some configurations excluded from the database for NN training were encountered during simulations, which may cause some difficulties on MD samplings, an adaptive procedure inspired by the selection scheme reported by Behler [Behler Int. J. Quantum Chem. 2015, 115, 1032; Behler Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2017, 56, 12828] was employed with some adaptions to update NN and carry out MD iteratively. We further applied the adaptive QM/MM-NN MD method to the free energy calculation and transition path optimization on chemical reactions in water. The results at the ab initio QM/MM level can be well reproduced using this method after 2–4 iteration cycles. The saving in computational cost is about 2 orders of magnitude. It demonstrates that the QM/MM-NN with direct MD simulations has great potentials not only for the calculation of thermodynamic properties but also for the characterization of reaction dynamics, which provides a useful tool to study chemical or biochemical systems in solution or enzymes.},

Growing concerns regarding the security of online medical data following breaches, and regarding regulations governing data ownership, mandate strict parameters in the development of efficient methods to administrate medical records. Furthermore, consideration must be placed on the rise of connected devices, which vastly increase the amount of data that can be collected in order to improve a patient’s long-term health outcomes. Increasing numbers of healthcare systems are developing Blockchain-based systems to manage medical data. A Blockchain is a decentralised, continuously growing online ledger of records, validated by members of the network. Traditionally used to manage cryptocurrency records, distributed ledger technology can be applied to various aspects of healthcare. In this manuscript, we focus on how Electronic Medical Records in particular can be managed by Blockchain, and how the introduction of this novel technology can create a more efficient and interoperable infrastructure to manage records that leads to improved healthcare outcomes, while maintaining patient data ownership and without compromising privacy or security of sensitive data.},

As this scheduling problem is NP-Hard, we propose a greedy algorithm that dynamically determines both the order and placement of each function execution using predictive models of function execution time and network latencies. We present a prototype implementation of our framework that uses AWS Lambda and OpenFaaS, for the public and private cloud, respectively. We evaluate our prototype in live experiments using a mixture of compute and I/O heavy serverless applications. Our results show that our framework can achieve a speedup in batch processing of up to 1.92 times that of an approach that uses only the private cloud, at 40.5\% the cost of an approach that uses only the public cloud.},

Accordingly, game theory is relevant in settings with multiple interacting controllers. This article presents an introduction to game theory, followed by a sampling of results in three specific control theory topics where game theory has played a significant role: (a) zero-sum games, in which the two competing players are a controller and an adversarial environment; (b) team games, in which several controllers pursue a common goal but have access to different information; and (c) distributed control, in which both a game and online adaptive rules are designed to enable distributed interacting subsystems to achieve a collective objective.},

These methods allow the scientist to explore and describe data and draw valid statistical inferences without the usual concerns for mathematical tractability. This is possible because traditional methods of mathematical analysis are replaced by specially constructed computer algorithms. Mathematics has not disappeared from statistical theory. It is the main method for deciding which algorithms are correct and efficient tools for automating statistical inference.},

The ‘lasso’ minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

In primary mouse neurons and immortalized human cells, polyQ inclusions consist of amyloid-like fibrils that interact with cellular endomembranes, particularly of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Interactions with these fibrils lead to membrane deformation, the local impairment of ER organization, and profound alterations in ER membrane dynamics at the inclusion periphery.

We focus on the poly-Gly-Ala (poly-GA) aggregates resulting from aberrant translation of an expanded GGGGCC repeat in C9orf72, the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. We find that poly-GA aggregates consist of densely packed twisted ribbons that recruit numerous 26S proteasome complexes, while other macromolecules are largely excluded. Proximity to poly-GA ribbons stabilizes a transient substrate-processing conformation of the 26S proteasome, suggesting stalled degradation. Thus, poly-GA aggregates may compromise neuronal proteostasis by driving the accumulation and functional impairment of a large fraction of cellular proteasomes.},

We catalog the ways in which fork is a terrible abstraction for the modern programmer to use, describe how it compromises OS implementations, and propose alternatives. As the designers and implementers of operating systems, we should acknowledge that fork's continued existence as a first-class OS primitive holds back systems research, and deprecate it.

	abstract = {Nuclear quantum effects (NQE) tend to generate delocalized molecular dynamics due to the inclusion of the zero point energy and its coupling with the anharmonicities in interatomic interactions. Here, we present evidence that NQE often enhance electronic interactions and, in turn, can result in dynamical molecular stabilization at finite temperature. The underlying physical mechanism promoted by NQE depends on the particular interaction under consideration. First, the effective reduction of interatomic distances between functional groups within a molecule can enhance the \$n{\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}*\$ interaction by increasing the overlap between molecular orbitals or by strengthening electrostatic interactions between neighboring charge densities. Second, NQE can localize methyl rotors by temporarily changing molecular bond orders and leading to the emergence of localized transient rotor states. Third, for noncovalent van der Waals interactions the strengthening comes from the increase of the polarizability given the expanded average interatomic distances induced by NQE. The implications of these boosted interactions include counterintuitive hydroxyl--hydroxyl bonding, hindered methyl rotor dynamics, and molecular stiffening which generates smoother free-energy surfaces. Our findings yield new insights into the versatile role of nuclear quantum fluctuations in molecules and materials.},

We discuss how such constraints are recovered and incorporated into ML models. Specifically, we use conservation of energy - a fundamental property of closed classical and quantum mechanical systems -- to derive an efficient gradient-domain machine learning (GDML) model. The challenge of constructing conservative force fields is accomplished by learning in a Hilbert space of vector-valued functions that obey the law of energy conservation. We proceed with the development of a multi-partite matching algorithm that enables a fully automated recovery of physically relevant point-group and fluxional symmetries from the training dataset into a symmetric variant of our model. The developed symmetric GDML (sGDML) approach is able to faithfully reproduce global force fields at the accuracy high-level ab initio methods, thus enabling sample intensive tasks like molecular dynamics simulations at that level of accuracy.},

Here we present the path for the construction of machine learned molecular force fields by discussing the hierarchical pathway from generating the dataset of reference calculations to the construction of the machine learning model, and the validation of the physics generated by the model. We will use the symmetrized gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) framework due to its ability to reconstruct complex high-dimensional potential-energy surfaces (PES) with high precision even when using just a few hundreds of molecular conformations for training. The data efficiency of the sGDML model allows using reference atomic forces computed with high-level wavefunction-based approaches, such as the \$gold\$ \$standard\$ coupled cluster method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations (CCSD(T)). We demonstrate that the flexible nature of the sGDML framework captures local and non-local electronic interactions (e.g. H-bonding, lone pairs, steric repulsion, changes in hybridization states (e.g. \$sp{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}rightleftharpoons sp{\textasciicircum}3\$), \$n{\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}*\$ interactions, and proton transfer) without imposing any restriction on the nature of interatomic potentials. The analysis of sGDML models trained for different molecular structures at different levels of theory (e.g. density functional theory and CCSD(T)) provides empirical evidence that a higher level of theory generates a smoother PES. Additionally, a careful analysis of molecular dynamics simulations yields new qualitative insights into dynamics and vibrational spectroscopy of small molecules close to spectroscopic accuracy.},

Furthermore, ISRIB treatment reverses spatial memory deficits and ameliorates working memory in old mice. At the cellular level in the hippocampus, ISR inhibition (i) rescues intrinsic neuronal electrophysiological properties, (ii) restores spine density and (iii) reduces immune profiles, specifically interferon and T cell-mediated responses.

To this end, much effort has been directed to maintaining even performance as the filesystem ages, rather than trying to support a particular narrow benchmark use-case. Linux filesystems are installed on smartphones as well as enterprise servers. This entails challenges on many different fronts. ---Scalability. The filesystem must scale in many dimensions: disk space, memory, and CPUs. ---Data integrity. Losing data is not an option, and much effort is expended to safeguard the content. This includes checksums, metadata duplication, and RAID support built into the filesystem. ---Disk diversity. The system should work well with SSDs and hard disks. It is also expected to be able to use an array of different sized disks, which poses challenges to the RAID and striping mechanisms. This article describes the core ideas, data structures, and algorithms of this filesystem.

Boson sampling is such a task and is considered as a strong candidate to demonstrate the quantum computational advantage. We perform Gaussian boson sampling by sending 50 indistinguishable single-mode squeezed states into a 100-mode ultralow-loss interferometer with full connectivity and random matrix—the whole optical setup is phase-locked—and sampling the output using 100 high-efficiency single-photon detectors. The obtained samples are validated against plausible hypotheses exploiting thermal states, distinguishable photons, and uniform distribution. The photonic quantum computer generates up to 76 output photon clicks, which yields an output state-space dimension of 1030 and a sampling rate that is {\textasciitilde}1014 faster than using the state-of-the-art simulation strategy and supercomputers.},

	abstract = {Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation is widely employed in studying diffusion mechanisms and in quantifying diffusional properties of materials. However, AIMD simulations are often limited to a few hundred atoms and a short, sub-nanosecond physical timescale, which leads to models that include only a limited number of diffusion events. As a result, the diffusional properties obtained from AIMD simulations are often plagued by poor statistics. In this paper, we re-examine the process to estimate diffusivity and ionic conductivity from the AIMD simulations and establish the procedure to minimize the fitting errors. In addition, we propose methods for quantifying the statistical variance of the diffusivity and ionic conductivity from the number of diffusion events observed during the AIMD simulation. Since an adequate number of diffusion events must be sampled, AIMD simulations should be sufficiently long and can only be performed on materials with reasonably fast diffusion. We chart the ranges of materials and physical conditions that can be accessible by AIMD simulations in studying diffusional properties. Our work provides the foundation for quantifying the statistical confidence levels of diffusion results from AIMD simulations and for correctly employing this powerful technique.},

Through the lens of attention, we analyze the inner workings of the Transformer and explore how the model discerns structural and functional properties of proteins. We show that attention (1) captures the folding structure of proteins, connecting amino acids that are far apart in the underlying sequence, but spatially close in the three-dimensional structure, (2) targets binding sites, a key functional component of proteins, and (3) focuses on progressively more complex biophysical properties with increasing layer depth. We also present a three-dimensional visualization of the interaction between attention and protein structure. Our findings align with known biological processes and provide a tool to aid discovery in protein engineering and synthetic biology.

Our approach uses the machine learning method Kriging (Gaussian Process Regression with a non-zero mean function) to predict these dynamic electron correlation energy contributions. The true energy values are calculated by partitioning the MP2 two-particle density-matrix via the Interacting Quantum Atoms (IQA) procedure. To our knowledge, this is the first time such energies have been predicted by a machine learning technique. We present here three important proof-of-concept cases: the water monomer, the water dimer, and the van der Waals complex H2···He. These cases represent the final step toward the design of a full IQA potential for molecular simulation. This final piece will enable us to consider situations in which dispersion is the dominant intermolecular interaction. The results from these examples suggest a new method by which dispersion potentials for molecular simulation can be generated.},

FFLUX models are constructed by applying the kriging machine learning method to the topological energy partitioning method, interacting quantum atoms (IQA). The effect of varying parameters in the construction of the FFLUX models is analyzed, with the most dominant effects found to be the structure of the molecule and the number of conformations used to build the model. Using these models, the optimization of a variety of small organic molecules is performed, with sub kJ mol–1 accuracy in the energy of the optimized molecules. The FFLUX models are also evaluated in terms of their performance in describing the potential energy surfaces (PESs) associated with specific degrees of freedoms within molecules. While the accurate description of PESs presents greater challenges than individual minima, FFLUX models are able to achieve errors of {\textless}2.5 kJ mol–1 across the full C–C–C–C dihedral PES of n-butane, indicating the future possibilities of the technique.},

Taking water as an example system, the FFLUX framework is shown capable of producing models that are flexible, polarizable and have a multipolar description of the electrostatics. The kriging machine-learning methods used in FFLUX are able to reproduce the intramolecular potential energy surface and multipole moments of a single water molecule with chemical accuracy using as few as 50 training configurations. Molecular dynamics simulations of water clusters (25–216 molecules) using the new FFLUX model reveal that incorporating charge-quadrupole, dipole–dipole, and quadrupole–charge interactions into the description of the electrostatics results in significant changes to the intermolecular structuring of the water molecules. © 2019 The Authors.

The ML-SQC approach allows the automatic tuning of SQC parameters for individual molecules, thereby improving the accuracy without deteriorating transferability to molecules with molecular descriptors very different from those in the training set. The performance of this approach is demonstrated for the semiempirical OM2 method using a set of 6095 constitutional isomers C7H10O2, for which accurate ab initio atomization enthalpies are available. The ML-OM2 results show improved average accuracy and a much reduced error range compared with those of standard OM2 results, with mean absolute errors in atomization enthalpies dropping from 6.3 to 1.7 kcal/mol. They are also found to be superior to the results from specific OM2 reparameterizations (rOM2) for the same set of isomers.

We unify concepts from many-body Hamiltonians with purpose-designed deep tensor neural networks, which leads to size-extensive and uniformly accurate (1 kcal mol−1) predictions in compositional and configurational chemical space for molecules of intermediate size. As an example of chemical relevance, the model reveals a classification of aromatic rings with respect to their stability. Further applications of our model for predicting atomic energies and local chemical potentials in molecules, reliable isomer energies, and molecules with peculiar electronic structure demonstrate the potential of machine learning for revealing insights into complex quantum-chemical systems.},

	abstract = {Simplified classical water models are currently an indispensable component in practical atomistic simulations. Yet, despite several decades of intense research, these models are still far from perfect. Presented here is an alternative approach to constructing widely used point charge water models. In contrast to the conventional approach, we do not impose any geometry constraints on the model other than the symmetry. Instead, we optimize the distribution of point charges to best describe the “electrostatics” of the water molecule. The resulting “optimal” 3-charge, 4-point rigid water model (OPC) reproduces a comprehensive set of bulk properties significantly more accurately than commonly used rigid models: average error relative to experiment is 0.76\%. Close agreement with experiment holds over a wide range of temperatures. The improvements in the proposed model extend beyond bulk properties: compared to common rigid models, predicted hydration free energies of small molecules using OPC are uniformly closer to experiment, with root-mean-square error {\textless}1 kcal/mol.},

Our parametrization method follows the AMOEBA procedure and introduces the use of QM intermolecular total interactions as well as QM energy decomposition analysis (EDA) to fit individual interaction energy components. The distributed multipoles for the cation and anions have been derived using both the Gaussian distributed multipole analysis (GDMA) and Gaussian electrostatic model-distributed multipole (GEM-DM) methods.1 The intermolecular interactions of a 1,3-dimethylimidazolium [dmim+] cation with various anions, including fluoride [F–], chloride [Cl–], nitrate [NO3–], and tetraflorouborate [BF4–], were studied using quantum chemistry calculations at the MP2/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. Energy decomposition analysis was performed for each pair using the restricted variational space decomposition approach (RVS) at the HF/6-311G(d,p) level. The new force field was validated by running a series of molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and by analyzing thermodynamic and structural properties of these systems. A number of thermodynamic properties obtained from MD simulations were compared with available experimental data. The ionic liquid structure reproduced using the AMOEBA force field is also compared with the data from neutron diffraction experiment and other MD simulations. Employing GEM-DM force fields resulted in a good agreement on liquid densities ρ, enthalpies of vaporization ΔHvap, and diffusion coefficients D± in comparison with conventional force fields.},

With computational tools increasingly becoming important in chemical research, methods have emerged to effectively face the challenge of modeling metal ions in the gas, aqueous, and solid phases. Herein, we review both quantum and classical modeling strategies for metal ion-containing systems that have been developed over the past few decades. This Review focuses on classical metal ion modeling based on unpolarized models (including the nonbonded, bonded, cationic dummy atom, and combined models), polarizable models (e.g., the fluctuating charge, Drude oscillator, and the induced dipole models), the angular overlap model, and valence bond-based models. Quantum mechanical studies of metal ion-containing systems at the semiempirical, ab initio, and density functional levels of theory are reviewed as well with a particular focus on how these methods inform classical modeling efforts. Finally, conclusions and future prospects and directions are offered that will further enhance the classical modeling of metal ion-containing systems.},

In this work, the GAFF Lennard-Jones parameters for the simulation of acyl chains are corrected to allow the accurate and stable simulation of pure lipid bilayers. Lipid bilayers comprised of six phospholipid types were simulated for timescales approaching a quarter of a microsecond under tensionless constant pressure conditions using Graphics Processing Units. Structural properties including area per lipid, volume per lipid, bilayer thickness, order parameter and headgroup hydration show favourable agreement with available experimental values. Expanding the system size from 72 to 288 lipids and a more experimentally realistic 2 × 288 lipid bilayer stack induces little change in the observed properties. This preliminary work is intended for combination with the new AMBER Lipid11 modular force field as part of on-going attempts to create a modular phospholipid AMBER force field allowing tensionless NPT simulations of complex lipid bilayers.},

	abstract = {The ability of the Amber ff99 force field to predict relative free energies of RNA helix formation was investigated. The test systems were three hexaloop RNA hairpins with identical loops and varying stems. The potential of mean force of stretching the hairpins from the native state to an extended conformation was calculated with umbrella sampling. Because the hairpins have identical loop sequence, the differences in free energy changes are only from the stem composition. The Amber ff99 force field was able to correctly predict the order of stabilities of the hairpins, although the magnitude of the free energy change is larger than that determined by optical melting experiments. The two measurements cannot be compared directly because the unfolded state in the optical melting experiments is a random coil, while the end state in the umbrella sampling simulations was an elongated chain. The calculations can be compared to reference data by using a thermodynamic cycle. By applying the thermodynamic cycle to the transitions between the hairpins using simulations and nearest-neighbor data, agreement was found to be within the sampling error of simulations, thus demonstrating that ff99 force field is able to accurately predict relative free energies of RNA helix formation.},

	abstract = {We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 Å, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 Å) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 Å, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 Å and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Å and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {We present the ff14ipq force field, implementing the previously published IPolQ charge set for simulations of complete proteins. Minor modifications to the charge derivation scheme and van der Waals interactions between polar atoms are introduced. Torsion parameters are developed through a generational learning approach, based on gas-phase MP2/cc-pVTZ single-point energies computed of structures optimized by the force field itself rather than the quantum benchmark. In this manner, we sacrifice information about the true quantum minima in order to ensure that the force field maintains optimal agreement with the MP2/cc-pVTZ benchmark for the ensembles it will actually produce in simulations. A means of making the gas-phase torsion parameters compatible with solution-phase IPolQ charges is presented. The ff14ipq model is an alternative to ff99SB and other Amber force fields for protein simulations in programs that accommodate pair-specific Lennard–Jones combining rules. The force field gives strong performance on α-helical and β-sheet oligopeptides as well as globular proteins over microsecond time scale simulations, although it has not yet been tested in conjunction with lipid and nucleic acid models. We show how our choices in parameter development influence the resulting force field and how other choices that may have appeared reasonable would actually have led to poorer results. The tools we developed may also aid in the development of future fixed-charge and even polarizable biomolecular force fields.},

	abstract = {The game of bridge consists of two stages: bidding and playing. While playing is proved to be relatively easy for computer programs, bidding is very challenging. During the bidding stage, each player knowing only his/her own cards needs to exchange information with his/her partner and interfere with opponents at the same time. Existing methods for solving perfect-information games cannot be directly applied to bidding. Most bridge programs are based on human-designed rules, which, however, cannot cover all situations and are usually ambiguous and even conflicting with each other. In this paper, we, for the first time, propose a competitive bidding system based on deep learning techniques, which exhibits two novelties. First, we design a compact representation to encode the private and public information available to a player for bidding. Second, based on the analysis of the impact of other players' unknown cards on one's final rewards, we design two neural networks to deal with imperfect information, the first one inferring the cards of the partner and the second one taking the outputs of the first one as part of its input to select a bid. Experimental results show that our bidding system outperforms the top rule-based program.},

	abstract = {It is well known that a jostled string tends to become knotted; yet the factors governing the “spontaneous” formation of various knots are unclear. We performed experiments in which a string was tumbled inside a box and found that complex knots often form within seconds. We used mathematical knot theory to analyze the knots. Above a critical string length, the probability P of knotting at first increased sharply with length but then saturated below 100\%. This behavior differs from that of mathematical self-avoiding random walks, where P has been proven to approach 100\%. Finite agitation time and jamming of the string due to its stiffness result in lower probability, but P approaches 100\% with long, flexible strings. We analyzed the knots by calculating their Jones polynomials via computer analysis of digital photos of the string. Remarkably, almost all were identified as prime knots: 120 different types, having minimum crossing numbers up to 11, were observed in 3,415 trials. All prime knots with up to seven crossings were observed. The relative probability of forming a knot decreased exponentially with minimum crossing number and Möbius energy, mathematical measures of knot complexity. Based on the observation that long, stiff strings tend to form a coiled structure when confined, we propose a simple model to describe the knot formation based on random “braid moves” of the string end. Our model can qualitatively account for the observed distribution of knots and dependence on agitation time and string length.},

Li–sulfur (Li–S) and Li–oxygen (Li–O2) batteries based on lithium metal anode possess a much higher theoretical energy density in comparison to the present lithium ion batteries. Nevertheless, some severe issues, such as the formation of Li dendrites on the metallic anode, Li polysulfide shuttle effect from the sulfur cathode, and oxygen/moisture erosion from the oxygen cathode, critically hinder their practical applications. Herein, general strategies to address these problems of Li metal anodes are introduced and the special issues for the cathodes in Li–S and Li–O2 batteries are discussed respectively.

	abstract = {Motivated by the long-term goal of understanding vectorial biological processes such as proton transport (PT) in biomolecular ion pumps, a number of developments were made to establish combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods suitable for studying chemical reactions involving significant charge separation in the condensed phase. These developments were summarized and discussed with representative problems. Specifically, free energy perturbation and boundary potential methods for treating long-range electrostatics were implemented to test the robustness of QM/MM results for protein systems. It was shown that consistent models with sufficient sampling were able to produce quantitatively satisfactory results, such as pKa for titritable groups in the interior of T4-lysozyme, while an inconsistent treatment of electrostatics or lack of sufficient sampling may produce incorrect results. Modifications were made to an approximate density functional theory (SCC-DFTB) to improve the description of proton affinity and hydrogen-bonding, which are crucial for the treatment of PT in polar systems. Test calculations on water autoionization showed clearly that both improvements are necessary for quantitatively reliable results. Finally, the newly established SCC-DFTB/MM-GSBP protocol was used to explore mechanistic issues in carbonic anhydrase (CA). Preliminary results suggest that PT in CA occurs mainly through short water wires containing two water molecules in a thermally activated fashion. Although longer water wires occur with similar frequencies, PT along those pathways, on average, has substantially higher barriers, a result not expected based on previous studies. The fluctuations of water molecules peripheral to the water wire were found to make a larger impact on the PT energetics compared to polar protein residues in the active site, which are largely pre-organized and therefore have less tendency to reorganize during the reaction.},

Phys. 1995, 102, 2851−2863] to calculate chemical potentials of liquids and solids, an ab initio simulation technique is devised, which introduces a fictitious dynamics of two superimposed but otherwise independent periodic systems including full electronic structure, such that either the chemical potential or the average fractional particle number of a specific chemical species can be kept constant. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that solvation free energies can be computed from these bicanonical ab initio simulations upon directly superimposing pure bulk water and the respective aqueous solution being the two limiting systems. The method is useful in many circumstances, for instance for studying heterogeneous catalytic processes taking place on surfaces where the chemical potential of reactants rather than their number is controlled and opens a pathway toward ab initio simulations at constant electrochemical potential.},

Due to the large size of biomolecules, applying standard quantum chemical methods to compute energies for dynamic simulation is computationally prohibitive. In this work, a fragment based ab initio molecular dynamics approach is presented for practical application in protein dynamics study. In this approach, the energy and forces of the protein are calculated by a recently developed electrostatically embedded generalized molecular fractionation with conjugate caps (EE-GMFCC) method. For simulation in explicit solvent, mechanical embedding is introduced to treat protein interaction with explicit water molecules. This AIMD approach has been applied to MD simulations of a small benchmark protein Trpcage (with 20 residues and 304 atoms) in both the gas phase and in solution. Comparison to the simulation result using the AMBER force field shows that the AIMD gives a more stable protein structure in the simulation, indicating that quantum chemical energy is more reliable. Importantly, the present fragment-based AIMD simulation captures quantum effects including electrostatic polarization and charge transfer that are missing in standard classical MD simulations. The current approach is linear-scaling, trivially parallel, and applicable to performing the AIMD simulation of proteins with a large size.},

On the 32 CASP13 FM (free-modeling) targets with a median multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth of 36, RaptorX yielded the best contact prediction among 46 groups and almost the best 3D structure modeling among all server groups without time-consuming conformation sampling. In particular, RaptorX achieved top L/5, L/2, and L long-range contact precision of 70\%, 58\%, and 45\%, respectively, and predicted correct folds (TMscore {\textgreater} 0.5) for 18 of 32 targets. Further, RaptorX predicted correct folds for all FM targets with {\textgreater}300 residues (T0950-D1, T0969-D1, and T1000-D2) and generated the best 3D models for T0950-D1 and T0969-D1 among all groups. This CASP13 test confirms our previous findings: (a) predicted distance is more useful than contacts for both template-based and free modeling; and (b) structure modeling may be improved by integrating template and coevolutionary information via deep learning. This paper will discuss progress we have made since CASP12, the strength and weakness of our methods, and why deep learning performed much better in CASP13.},

We show that we can accurately predict interresidue distance distribution of a protein by deep learning, even for proteins with ∼60 sequence homologs. Using only the geometric constraints given by the resulting distance matrix we may construct 3D models without involving extensive conformation sampling. Our method successfully folded 21 of the 37 CASP12 hard targets with a median family size of 58 effective sequence homologs within 4 h on a Linux computer of 20 central processing units. In contrast, DCA-predicted contacts cannot be used to fold any of these hard targets in the absence of extensive conformation sampling, and the best CASP12 group folded only 11 of them by integrating DCA-predicted contacts into fragment-based conformation sampling. Rigorous experimental validation in CASP13 shows that our distance-based folding server successfully folded 17 of 32 hard targets (with a median family size of 36 sequence homologs) and obtained 70\% precision on the top L/5 long-range predicted contacts. The latest experimental validation in CAMEO shows that our server predicted correct folds for 2 membrane proteins while all of the other servers failed. These results demonstrate that it is now feasible to predict correct fold for many more proteins lack of similar structures in the Protein Data Bank even on a personal computer.},

Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes and their comparative analysis, complete descriptions of interactomes and their comparative analysis is fundamental to a deeper understanding of biological processes. A first step in such an analysis is to align two or more PPI networks. Here, we introduce an algorithm, IsoRank, for global alignment of multiple PPI networks. The guiding intuition here is that a protein in one PPI network is a good match for a protein in another network if their respective sequences and neighborhood topologies are a good match. We encode this intuition as an eigenvalue problem in a manner analogous to Google's PageRank method. Using IsoRank, we compute a global alignment of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens PPI networks. We demonstrate that incorporating PPI data in ortholog prediction results in improvements over existing sequence-only approaches and over predictions from local alignments of the yeast and fly networks. Previous methods have been effective at identifying conserved, localized network patterns across pairs of networks. This work takes the further step of performing a global alignment of multiple PPI networks. It simultaneously uses sequence similarity and network data and, unlike previous approaches, explicitly models the tradeoff inherent in combining them. We expect IsoRank—with its simultaneous handling of node similarity and network similarity—to be applicable across many scientific domains.},

These potentials mainly distinguish themselves in the reference state and use a similar simple counting method to estimate the observed probability, which is usually assumed to correlate with only atom types. This paper takes a rather different view on the observed probability and parameterizes it by the protein sequence profile context of the atoms and the radius of the gyration, in addition to atom types. Experiments confirm that our position-specific statistical potential outperforms currently the popular ones in several decoy discrimination tests.

	abstract = {Graphical models are powerful in modeling a variety of real-world applications. Computing the partition function of a graphical model is known as an NP-hard problem for a general graph. A few sampling algorithms like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Simulated Annealing Sampling (SAS), Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) are developed to approximate the partition function. This paper presents a new Langevin Importance Sampling (LIS) algorithm to address this challenge. LIS performs a random walk in the conﬁguration-temperature space guided by the Langevin equation and estimates the partition function using all the samples generated during the random walk at all the temperatures, as opposed to the other conﬁguration-temperature sampling methods, which use only the samples at a speciﬁc temperature. Experimental results on several benchmark graphical models show that LIS can obtain much more accurate partition function than the others. LIS performs especially well on relatively large graphical models or those with a large number of local optima.},

	abstract = {Sequence-based protein homology detection has been extensively studied and so far the most sensitive method is based upon comparison of protein sequence profiles, which are derived from multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of sequence homologs in a protein family. A sequence profile is usually represented as a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) or an HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and accordingly PSSM-PSSM or HMM-HMM comparison is used for homolog detection. This paper presents a new homology detection method MRFalign, consisting of three key components: 1) a Markov Random Fields (MRF) representation of a protein family; 2) a scoring function measuring similarity of two MRFs; and 3) an efficient ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) algorithm aligning two MRFs. Compared to HMM that can only model very short-range residue correlation, MRFs can model long-range residue interaction pattern and thus, encode information for the global 3D structure of a protein family. Consequently, MRF-MRF comparison for remote homology detection shall be much more sensitive than HMM-HMM or PSSM-PSSM comparison. Experiments confirm that MRFalign outperforms several popular HMM or PSSM-based methods in terms of both alignment accuracy and remote homology detection and that MRFalign works particularly well for mainly beta proteins. For example, tested on the benchmark SCOP40 (8353 proteins) for homology detection, PSSM-PSSM and HMM-HMM succeed on 48\% and 52\% of proteins, respectively, at superfamily level, and on 15\% and 27\% of proteins, respectively, at fold level. In contrast, MRFalign succeeds on 57.3\% and 42.5\% of proteins at superfamily and fold level, respectively. This study implies that long-range residue interaction patterns are very helpful for sequence-based homology detection.

The quality of these extracted fragments, which are used to build protein-specific fragment libraries, can determine the success or failure of sampling near-native conformations. Here we show how a high-quality fragment library can be built using deep contextual learning techniques. Our algorithm, called DeepFragLib, employs bidirectional long short-term-memory recurrent neural networks with knowledge distillation for initial fragment classification, followed by an aggregated residual transformation network with cyclically dilated convolution for detecting near-native fragments. DeepFragLib improves the position-averaged proportion of near-native fragments by 12.2\% over existing methods and, consequently, produces better near-native structures for 72.0\% of the free-modelling domain targets tested when integrated with Rosetta. DeepFragLib is fully parallelized and available for use in conjunction with structure prediction programs.},

Two systems assembled fragments produced by a generative neural network, one using scores from a network trained to regress GDT\_TS. The third system shows that simple gradient descent on a properly constructed potential is able to perform on par with more expensive traditional search techniques and without requiring domain segmentation. In the CASP13 FM assessors' ranking by summed z-scores, this system scored highest with 68.3 vs 48.2 for the next closest group (an average GDT\_TS of 61.4). The system produced high-accuracy structures (with GDT\_TS scores of 70 or higher) for 11 out of 43 FM domains.

Due to multifaceted issues and challenges in the implementation of the safety and preventive measures, inconsistent coordination between societies-governments and most importantly lack of specific vaccine to SARS-CoV-2, the spread of the virus that initially emerged at Wuhan is still uprising after taking a heavy toll on human life. In the present study, we mapped immunogenic epitopes present on the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and we designed a multi-epitope peptide based vaccine that, demonstrated a high immunogenic response with a vast application on world’s human population. On codon optimization and in-silico cloning, we found that candidate vaccine showed high expression in E. coli and immune simulation resulted in inducing a high level of both B-cell and T-cell mediated immunity. The results predicted that exposure of vaccine by administrating three injections significantly subsidized the antigen growth in the system. The proposed candidate vaccine found promising by yielding desired results and hence, should be validated by practical experimentations for its functioning and efficacy to neutralize SARS-CoV-2.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Protein functions are largely determined by the final details of their tertiary structures, and the structures could be accurately reconstructed based on inter-residue distances. Residue co-evolution has become the primary principle for estimating inter-residue distances since the residues in close spatial proximity tend to co-evolve. The widely-used approaches infer residue co-evolution using an indirect strategy, i.e., they first extract from the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of query protein some handcrafted features, say, co-variance matrix, and then infer residue co-evolution using these features rather than the raw information carried by MSA. This indirect strategy always leads to considerable information loss and inaccurate estimation of inter-residue distances. Here, we report a deep neural network framework (called CopulaNet) to learn residue co-evolution directly from MSA without any handcrafted features. The CopulaNet consists of two key elements: i) an encoder to model context-specific mutation for each residue, and ii) an aggregator to model correlations among residues and thereafter infer residue co-evolutions. Using the CASP13 (the 13th Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction) target proteins as representatives, we demonstrated the successful application of CopulaNet for estimating inter-residue distances and further predicting protein tertiary structure with improved accuracy and efficiency. Head-to-head comparison suggested that for 24 out of the 31 free modeling CASP13 domains, ProFOLD outperformed AlphaFold, one of the state-of-the-art prediction approaches.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Recent findings show that inter-residue distance prediction, a more granular version of the well-known contact prediction problem, is a key to predicting accurate models. However, deep learning methods that predict these distances are still in the early stages of their development. To advance these methods and develop other novel methods, a need exists for a small and representative dataset packaged for faster development and testing. In this work, we introduce protein distance net (PDNET), a framework that consists of one such representative dataset along with the scripts for training and testing deep learning methods. The framework also includes all the scripts that were used to curate the dataset, and generate the input features and distance maps. Deep learning models can also be trained and tested in a web browser using free platforms such as Google Colab. We discuss how PDNET can be used to predict contacts, distance intervals, and real-valued distances.},

Our results show that our model can generalize from single-timestep predictions with thousands of particles during training, to different initial conditions, thousands of timesteps, and at least an order of magnitude more particles at test time. Our model was robust to hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with noise. Our GNS framework advances the state-of-the-art in learned physical simulation, and holds promise for solving a wide range of complex forward and inverse problems.},

	abstract = {Neuromorphic computing draws inspiration from the brain to provide computing technology and architecture with the potential to drive the next wave of computer engineering1–13. Such brain-inspired computing also provides a promising platform for the development of artificial general intelligence14,15. However, unlike conventional computing systems, which have a well established computer hierarchy built around the concept of Turing completeness and the von Neumann architecture16–18, there is currently no generalized system hierarchy or understanding of completeness for brain-inspired computing. This affects the compatibility between software and hardware, impairing the programming flexibility and development productivity of brain-inspired computing. Here we propose ‘neuromorphic completeness’, which relaxes the requirement for hardware completeness, and a corresponding system hierarchy, which consists of a Turing-complete software-abstraction model and a versatile abstract neuromorphic architecture. Using this hierarchy, various programs can be described as uniform representations and transformed into the equivalent executable on any neuromorphic complete hardware—that is, it ensures programming-language portability, hardware completeness and compilation feasibility. We implement toolchain software to support the execution of different types of program on various typical hardware platforms, demonstrating the advantage of our system hierarchy, including a new system-design dimension introduced by the neuromorphic completeness. We expect that our study will enable efficient and compatible progress in all aspects of brain-inspired computing systems, facilitating the development of various applications, including artificial general intelligence.},

Because of the fundamental differences in their formulations and coding schemes, these two approaches rely on distinct and incompatible platforms2–8, retarding the development of AGI. A general platform that could support the prevailing computer-science-based artificial neural networks as well as neuroscience-inspired models and algorithms is highly desirable. Here we present the Tianjic chip, which integrates the two approaches to provide a hybrid, synergistic platform. The Tianjic chip adopts a many-core architecture, reconfigurable building blocks and a streamlined dataflow with hybrid coding schemes, and can not only accommodate computer-science-based machine-learning algorithms, but also easily implement brain-inspired circuits and several coding schemes. Using just one chip, we demonstrate the simultaneous processing of versatile algorithms and models in an unmanned bicycle system, realizing real-time object detection, tracking, voice control, obstacle avoidance and balance control. Our study is expected to stimulate AGI development by paving the way to more generalized hardware platforms.},

	abstract = {One of the long-standing challenges in experimental physics is the observation of room-temperature superconductivity1,2. Recently, high-temperature conventional superconductivity in hydrogen-rich materials has been reported in several systems under high pressure3–5. An  important discovery leading to room-temperature superconductivity is the pressure-driven disproportionation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to H3S, with a confirmed transition temperature of 203 kelvin at 155 gigapascals3,6. Both H2S and CH4 readily mix with hydrogen to form guest–host structures at lower pressures7, and are of  comparable size at 4 gigapascals. By introducing methane at low pressures into the H2S + H2 precursor mixture for H3S, molecular exchange is allowed within a large assemblage of van der Waals solids that are hydrogen-rich with H2 inclusions; these guest–host structures become the building blocks of superconducting compounds at extreme conditions. Here we report superconductivity in a photochemically transformed carbonaceous sulfur hydride system, starting from elemental precursors, with a maximum superconducting transition temperature of 287.7 ± 1.2 kelvin (about 15 degrees Celsius) achieved at 267 ± 10 gigapascals. The superconducting state is observed over a broad pressure range in the diamond anvil cell, from 140 to 275 gigapascals, with a sharp upturn in transition temperature above 220 gigapascals. Superconductivity is established by the observation of zero resistance, a magnetic susceptibility of up to 190 gigapascals, and reduction of the transition temperature under an external magnetic field of up to 9 tesla, with an upper critical magnetic field of about 62 tesla according to the Ginzburg–Landau model at zero temperature. The light, quantum nature of hydrogen limits the structural and stoichiometric determination of the system by X-ray scattering techniques, but Raman spectroscopy is used to probe the chemical and structural transformations before metallization. The introduction of chemical tuning within our ternary system could enable the preservation of the properties of room-temperature superconductivity at lower pressures.},

	abstract = {We have performed density functional theory calculations to investigate the convergence of reaction barriers with respect to zeolite cluster size, for multistep reactions catalyzed in HZSM-5. We constructed cluster models of HZSM-5 using the delta-cluster approach reported previously by us. We then computed barriers for different reaction types to determine the cluster sizes and neighbor-list radii needed to fully treat zeolite confinement effects. In particular, we studied the acid-zeolite-catalyzed aldol reactions of acetone with formaldehyde, furfural, and hydroxymethyl-furfural, in three steps: keto/enol tautomerization of acetone, combination between each aldehyde and the enol, and aldol dehydration. We found that the delta-cluster radius of 4.0 Å consistently converges barriers with respect to cluster size, yielding complete treatments of confinement in HZSM-5 with clusters containing up to 99 atoms. For comparison, periodic density functional theory (DFT) on HZSM-5 includes 288 atoms, requiring 19 times more CPU time in head-to-head comparisons. Our converged acetone–formaldehyde dehydration barrier agrees quantitatively with a comparable barrier obtained with periodic DFT, showing that cluster calculations can converge properties at a fraction of the cost of periodic DFT. Interestingly, we found that the bulkier, furan-containing aldehydes exhibit faster reactivity because of charge delocalization from aromatic rings, which significantly speeds up aldol dehydration.},

	abstract = {Despite intense interest in discovering drugs that cause G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to selectively stimulate or block arrestin signalling, the structural mechanism of receptor-mediated arrestin activation remains unclear1,2. Here we reveal this mechanism through extensive atomic-level simulations of arrestin. We find that the receptor’s transmembrane core and cytoplasmic tail—which bind distinct surfaces on arrestin—can each independently stimulate arrestin activation. We confirm this unanticipated role of the receptor core, and the allosteric coupling between these distant surfaces of arrestin, using site-directed fluorescence spectroscopy. The effect of the receptor core on arrestin conformation is mediated primarily by interactions of the intracellular loops of the receptor with the arrestin body, rather than the marked finger-loop rearrangement that is observed upon receptor binding. In the absence of a receptor, arrestin frequently adopts active conformations when its own C-terminal tail is disengaged, which may explain why certain arrestins remain active long after receptor dissociation. Our results, which suggest that diverse receptor binding modes can activate arrestin, provide a structural foundation for the design of functionally selective (‘biased’) GPCR-targeted ligands with desired effects on arrestin signalling.},

	abstract = {A short, 14-amino-acid segment called SP1, located in the Gag structural protein1, has a critical role during the formation of the HIV-1 virus particle. During virus assembly, the SP1 peptide and seven preceding residues fold into a six-helix bundle, which holds together the Gag hexamer and facilitates the formation of a curved immature hexagonal lattice underneath the viral membrane2,3. Upon completion of assembly and budding, proteolytic cleavage of Gag leads to virus maturation, in which the immature lattice is broken down; the liberated CA domain of Gag then re-assembles into the mature conical capsid that encloses the viral genome and associated enzymes. Folding and proteolysis of the six-helix bundle are crucial rate-limiting steps of both Gag assembly and disassembly, and the six-helix bundle is an established target of HIV-1 inhibitors4,5. Here, using a combination of structural and functional analyses, we show that inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6, also known as IP6) facilitates the formation of the six-helix bundle and assembly of the immature HIV-1 Gag lattice. IP6 makes ionic contacts with two rings of lysine residues at the centre of the Gag hexamer. Proteolytic cleavage then unmasks an alternative binding site, where IP6 interaction promotes the assembly of the mature capsid lattice. These studies identify IP6 as a naturally occurring small molecule that promotes both assembly and maturation of HIV-1.},

	abstract = {Aided by efforts to improve their speed and efficiency, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide an increasingly powerful tool to study the structure–function relationship of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs). However, accurate reporting of the channel state and observation of allosteric regulation by agonist binding with MD remains difficult due to the timescales necessary to equilibrate pLGICs from their artificial and crystalized conformation to a more native, membrane-bound conformation in silico. Here, we perform multiple all-atom MD simulations of the homomeric 5-hydroxytryptamine 3A (5-HT
              3A
              ) serotonin receptor for 15 to 20 μs to demonstrate that such timescales are critical to observe the equilibration of a pLGIC from its crystalized conformation to a membrane-bound conformation. These timescales, which are an order of magnitude longer than any previous simulation of 5-HT
              3A
              , allow us to observe the dynamic binding and unbinding of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (i.e., serotonin) to the binding pocket located on the extracellular domain (ECD) and allosteric regulation of the transmembrane domain (TMD) from synergistic 5-HT binding. While these timescales are not long enough to observe complete activation of 5-HT
              3A
              , the allosteric regulation of ion gating elements by 5-HT binding is indicative of a preactive state, which provides insight into molecular mechanisms that regulate channel activation from a resting state. This mechanistic insight, enabled by microsecond-timescale MD simulations, will allow a careful examination of the regulation of pLGICs at a molecular level, expanding our understanding of their function and elucidating key structural motifs that can be targeted for therapeutic regulation.},

The local environments of both the inactive state and the partially active state of the receptor are significantly enriched with unsaturated chains but depleted of cholesterol and saturated chains, relative to the bulk membrane composition. In spite of the local depletion of cholesterol, the partially active receptor binds cholesterol at three locations during the entire simulation trajectory.

Both voltage activation and proton conduction are carried out by a voltage-sensing domain (VSD) with strong similarity to canonical VSDs in voltage-dependent cation channels and enzymes. We set out to determine the structural properties of membrane-reconstituted human proton channel (hHv1) in its resting conformation using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy together with biochemical and computational methods. We evaluated existing structural templates and generated a spectroscopically constrained model of the hHv1 dimer based on the Ci-VSD structure at resting state. Mapped accessibility data revealed deep water penetration through hHv1, suggesting a highly focused electric field, comprising two turns of helix along the fourth transmembrane segment.

The main finding is that proteins that are not known to specifically interact with membranes are preferentially excluded from the membrane, leaving a depletion zone near the membrane surface. As a consequence, effective protein concentrations increase, leading to increased protein contacts and clustering, whereas protein diffusion becomes faster near the membrane for proteins that do occasionally enter the depletion zone. Since protein–membrane contacts are infrequent and short-lived in this study, the structure of the lipid bilayer remains largely unaffected by the crowded protein solution, but when proteins do contact lipid head groups, small but statistically significant local membrane curvature is induced, on average.},

              The effects of detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) on protein structure and dynamics are fundamental to the most common laboratory technique used to separate proteins and determine their molecular weights: polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, the mechanism by which SDS induces protein unfolding and the microstructure of protein–SDS complexes remain largely unknown. Here, we report a detailed account of SDS-induced unfolding of two proteins—I27 domain of titin and β-amylase—obtained through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Both proteins were found to spontaneously unfold in the presence of SDS at boiling water temperature on the time scale of several microseconds. The protein unfolding was found to occur
              via
              two distinct mechanisms in which specific interactions of individual SDS molecules disrupt the protein's secondary structure. In the final state of the unfolding process, the proteins are found to wrap around SDS micelles in a fluid necklace-and-beads configuration, where the number and location of bound micelles changes dynamically. The global conformation of the protein was found to correlate with the number of SDS micelles bound to it, whereas the number of SDS molecules directly bound to the protein was found to define the relaxation time scale of the unfolded protein. Our microscopic characterization of SDS–protein interactions sets the stage for future refinement of SDS–enabled protein characterization methods, including protein fingerprinting and sequencing using a solid-state nanopore.},

	abstract = {Rationale:
              Drug-induced proarrhythmia is so tightly associated with prolongation of the QT interval that QT prolongation is an accepted surrogate marker for arrhythmia. But QT interval is too sensitive a marker and not selective, resulting in many useful drugs eliminated in drug discovery.
            
            
              Objective:
              To predict the impact of a drug from the drug chemistry on the cardiac rhythm.
            
            
              Methods and Results:
              In a new linkage, we connected atomistic scale information to protein, cell, and tissue scales by predicting drug-binding affinities and rates from simulation of ion channel and drug structure interactions and then used these values to model drug effects on the hERG channel. Model components were integrated into predictive models at the cell and tissue scales to expose fundamental arrhythmia vulnerability mechanisms and complex interactions underlying emergent behaviors. Human clinical data were used for model framework validation and showed excellent agreement, demonstrating feasibility of a new approach for cardiotoxicity prediction.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              We present a multiscale model framework to predict electrotoxicity in the heart from the atom to the rhythm. Novel mechanistic insights emerged at all scales of the system, from the specific nature of proarrhythmic drug interaction with the hERG channel, to the fundamental cellular and tissue-level arrhythmia mechanisms. Applications of machine learning indicate necessary and sufficient parameters that predict arrhythmia vulnerability. We expect that the model framework may be expanded to make an impact in drug discovery, drug safety screening for a variety of compounds and targets, and in a variety of regulatory processes.},

	abstract = {Recent genetic studies have established that hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is causally related to cardiovascular disease, making it an active area for drug development. We describe a strategy for lowering triglycerides (TGs) with an apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II) mimetic peptide called D6PV that activates lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the main plasma TG-hydrolyzing enzyme, and antagonizes the TG-raising effect of apoC-III. The design of D6PV was motivated by a combination of all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of apoC-II on the Anton 2 supercomputer, structural prediction programs, and biophysical techniques. Efficacy of D6PV was assessed ex vivo in human HTG plasma and was found to be more potent than full-length apoC-II in activating LPL. D6PV markedly lowered TG by more than 80\% within a few hours in both apoC-II–deficient mice and h
              APOC3
              -transgenic (Tg) mice. In h
              APOC3
              -Tg mice, D6PV treatment reduced plasma apoC-III by 80\% and apoB by 65\%. Furthermore, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol did not accumulate but rather was decreased by 10\% when h

              ) mice, confirming that it can also act independently of LPL. D6PV displayed good subcutaneous bioavailability of about 80\% in nonhuman primates. Because it binds to high-density lipoproteins, which serve as a long-term reservoir, it also has an extended terminal half-life (42 to 50 hours) in nonhuman primates. In summary, D6PV decreases plasma TG by acting as a dual apoC-II mimetic and apoC-III antagonist, thereby demonstrating its potential as a treatment for HTG.},

	abstract = {We characterize the conformational dynamics and substrate selectivity of the signal recognition particle (SRP) using a thermodynamic free energy cycle approach and microsecond timescale molecular dynamics simulations. The SRP is a central component of the co-translational protein targeting machinery that binds to the N-terminal signal peptide (SP) of nascent proteins. We determined the shift in relative conformational stability of the SRP upon substrate binding to quantify allosteric coupling between SRP domains. In particular, for dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, an SP that is recognized by the SRP for co-translational targeting, it is found that substrate binding induces substantial changes in the SRP toward configurations associated with targeting of the nascent protein, and it is found that the changes are modestly enhanced by a mutation that increases the hydrophobicity of the SP. However, for alkaline phosphatase, an SP that is recognized for post-translational targeting, substrate binding induces the reverse change in the SRP conformational distribution away from targeting configurations. Microsecond timescale trajectories reveal the intrinsic flexibility of the SRP conformational landscape and provide insight into recent single molecule studies by illustrating that 10-nm lengthscale changes between FRET pairs occur via the rigid-body movement of SRP domains connected by the flexible linker region. In combination, these results provide direct evidence for the hypothesis that substrate-controlled conformational switching in the SRP provides a mechanism for discriminating between different SPs and for connecting substrate binding to downstream steps in the protein targeting pathway.},

          , 
            
              Cross-sequence interactions between different amyloid peptides are important not only for the fundamental understanding of amyloid aggregation and polymorphism mechanisms, but also for probing a potential molecular link between different amyloid diseases. Here, we computationally modeled and simulated a series of hybrid hIAPP (human islet amyloid polypeptide)–rIAPP (rat islet amyloid polypeptide) assemblies and probed their structural stability, lateral association, and interfacial interactions using combined peptide-packing search, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and the Monte Carlo sampling method. We then identified a number of stable and highly populated hIAPP–rIAPP assemblies at the lowest energy states, in which hIAPP and rIAPP oligomers were stacked laterally on top of each other to form supramolecular β-sheet double layers in an antiparallel fashion. These hIAPP–rIAPP assemblies adopted different interfaces formed by C-terminal β-sheets of hIAPP and rIAPP oligomers (
              h
              CC
              r
              ), N-terminal β-sheets of hIAPP and rIAPP oligomers (
              h
              NN
              r
              ), and alternative N-terminal/C-terminal β-sheets of hIAPP and rIAPP oligomers (
              h
              NC
              r
              and
              h
              CN
              r
              ). Different interfaces along with distinct interfacial residue packings provided different driving interfacial forces to laterally associate two β-sheet layers of hIAPP and rIAPP together for forming polymorphic hIAPP–rIAPP assemblies. Such lateral association between hIAPP and rIAPP not only explained the experimentally observed cross-seeding behavior of hIAPP and rIAPP, but also demonstrated the co-existence of polymorphic amyloid cross-seeding species. A cross-seeding mechanism for hIAPP and rIAPP aggregation was proposed on the basis of our simulated models and experimental data. This work provides a better understanding of cross-seeding aggregation and polymorphism mechanisms of amyloidogenesis.},

	abstract = {The Na+/K+-pump maintains the physiological K+ and Na+ electrochemical gradients across the cell membrane. It operates via an 'alternating-access' mechanism, making iterative transitions between inward-facing (E1) and outward-facing (E2) conformations. Although the general features of the transport cycle are known, the detailed physicochemical factors governing the binding site selectivity remain mysterious. Free energy molecular dynamics simulations show that the ion binding sites switch their binding specificity in E1 and E2. This is accompanied by small structural arrangements and changes in protonation states of the coordinating residues. Additional computations on structural models of the intermediate states along the conformational transition pathway reveal that the free energy barrier toward the occlusion step is considerably increased when the wrong type of ion is loaded into the binding pocket, prohibiting the pump cycle from proceeding forward. This self-correcting mechanism strengthens the overall transport selectivity and protects the stoichiometry of the pump cycle.

            A protein called the sodium-potassium pump resides in the membrane that surrounds living cells. The role of this protein is to 'pump' sodium and potassium ions across the membrane to help restore their concentration inside and outside of the cell. About 25\% of the body's energy is used to keep the pump going, rising to nearly 70\% in the brain. Problems that affect the pump have been linked to several disorders, including heart, kidney and metabolic diseases, as well as severe neurological conditions.
            The sodium-potassium pump must be able to effectively pick out the correct ions to transport from a mixture of many different types of ions. However, it was not clear how the pump succeeds in doing this efficiently. Rui et al. have now used a computational method called molecular dynamics simulations to model how the sodium-potassium pump transports the desired ions across the cell membrane.
            The pump works via a so-called 'alternating-access' mechanism, repeatedly transitioning between inward-facing and outward-facing conformations. In each cycle, it binds three sodium ions from the cell’s interior and exports them to the outside. Then, the pump binds to two potassium ions from outside the cell and imports them inside. Although the bound sodium and potassium ions interact with similar binding sites in the pump, the pump sometimes preferentially binds sodium, and sometimes potassium. The study performed by Rui et al. shows that this preference is driven by how protons (hydrogen ions) bind to the amino acids that make up the binding site.
            The simulations also suggest that the pump uses a ‘self-correcting’ mechanism to prevent the pump from transporting the wrong types of ions. When incorrect ions are present at the binding sites, the pump cycle pauses temporarily until the ions detach from the pump. Only when the correct ions are bound will the pump cycle continue again.
            In the future, Rui et al. hope to use long time-scale molecular dynamics simulations to show the conformational transition in action. In addition, the 'self-correcting' mechanism will be directly tested by letting the wrong and correct ions compete for the binding sites to see whether the pump will transport only the correct ions.},

	abstract = {Nucleocytoplasmic transport is mediated by the interaction of transport factors (TFs) with disordered phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats that fill the central channel of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). However, the mechanism by which TFs rapidly diffuse through multiple FG repeats without compromising NPC selectivity is not yet fully understood. In this study, we build on our recent NMR investigations showing that FG repeats are highly dynamic, flexible, and rapidly exchanging among TF interaction sites. We use unbiased long timescale all-atom simulations on the Anton supercomputer, combined with extensive enhanced sampling simulations and NMR experiments, to characterize the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of FG repeats and their interaction with a model transport factor. Both the simulations and experimental data indicate that FG repeats are highly dynamic random coils, lack intrachain interactions, and exhibit significant entropically driven resistance to spatial confinement. We show that the FG motifs reversibly slide in and out of multiple TF interaction sites, transitioning rapidly between a strongly interacting state and a weakly interacting state, rather than undergoing a much slower transition between strongly interacting and completely noninteracting (unbound) states. In the weakly interacting state, FG motifs can be more easily displaced by other competing FG motifs, providing a simple mechanism for rapid exchange of TF/FG motif contacts during transport. This slide-and-exchange mechanism highlights the direct role of the disorder within FG repeats in nucleocytoplasmic transport, and resolves the apparent conflict between the selectivity and speed of transport.},

	abstract = {Myosin VI (MVI) is the only known member of the myosin superfamily that, upon dimerization, walks processively toward the pointed end of the actin filament. The leading head of the dimer directs the trailing head forward with a power stroke, a conformational change of the motor domain exaggerated by the lever arm. Using a unique coarse-grained model for the power stroke of a single MVI, we provide the molecular basis for its motility. We show that the power stroke occurs in two major steps. First, the motor domain attains the poststroke conformation without directing the lever arm forward; and second, the lever arm reaches the poststroke orientation by undergoing a rotational diffusion. From the analysis of the trajectories, we discover that the potential that directs the rotating lever arm toward the poststroke conformation is almost flat, implying that the lever arm rotation is mostly uncoupled from the motor domain. Because a backward load comparable to the largest interhead tension in a MVI dimer prevents the rotation of the lever arm, our model suggests that the leading-head lever arm of a MVI dimer is uncoupled, in accord with the inference drawn from polarized total internal reflection fluorescence (polTIRF) experiments. Without any adjustable parameter, our simulations lead to quantitative agreement with polTIRF experiments, which validates the structural insights. Finally, in addition to making testable predictions, we also discuss the implications of our model in explaining the broad step-size distribution of the MVI stepping pattern.},

	abstract = {Secondary active transporters, such as those that adopt the leucine-transporter fold, are found in all domains of life, and they have the unique capability of harnessing the energy stored in ion gradients to accumulate small molecules essential for life as well as expel toxic and harmful compounds. How these proteins couple ion binding and transport to the concomitant flow of substrates is a fundamental structural and biophysical question that is beginning to be answered at the atomistic level with the advent of high-resolution structures of transporters in different structural states. Nonetheless, the dynamic character of the transporters, such as ion/substrate binding order and how binding triggers conformational change, is not revealed from static structures, yet it is critical to understanding their function. Here, we report a series of molecular simulations carried out on the sugar transporter vSGLT that lend insight into how substrate and ions are released from the inward-facing state of the transporter. Our simulations reveal that the order of release is stochastic. Functional experiments were designed to test this prediction on the human homolog, hSGLT1, and we also found that cytoplasmic release is not ordered, but we confirmed that substrate and ion binding from the extracellular space is ordered. Our findings unify conflicting published results concerning cytoplasmic release of ions and substrate and hint at the possibility that other transporters in the superfamily may lack coordination between ions and substrate in the inward-facing state.},

              channels, prolonged activating stimuli lead to a time-dependent reduction in ion conduction, a phenomenon known as C-type inactivation. X-ray structures of the KcsA channel suggest that this inactivated state corresponds to a “constricted” conformation of the selectivity filter. However, the functional significance of the constricted conformation has become a matter of debate. Functional and structural studies based on chemically modified semisynthetic KcsA channels along the selectivity filter led to the conclusion that the constricted conformation does not correspond to the C-type inactivated state. The main results supporting this view include the observation that C-type inactivation is not suppressed by a substitution of D-alanine at Gly77, even though this modification is believed to lock the selectivity filter into its conductive conformation, whereas it is suppressed following amide-to-ester backbone substitutions at Gly77 and Tyr78, even though these structure-conserving modifications are not believed to prevent the selectivity filter from adopting the constricted conformation. However, several untested assumptions about the structural and functional impact of these chemical modifications underlie these arguments. To make progress, molecular dynamics simulations based on atomic models of the KcsA channel were performed. The computational results support the notion that the constricted conformation of the selectivity filter corresponds to the functional C-type inactivated state of the KcsA. Importantly, MD simulations reveal that the semisynthetic KcsA
              D-ala77
              channel can adopt an asymmetrical constricted-like nonconductive conformation and that the amide-to-ester backbone substitutions at Gly77 and Tyr78 perturb the hydrogen bonding involving the buried water molecules stabilizing the constricted conformation.},

	abstract = {The microtubule (MT)-associated motor protein kinesin utilizes its conserved ATPase head to achieve diverse motility characteristics. Despite considerable knowledge about how its ATPase activity and MT binding are coupled to the motility cycle, the atomic mechanism of the core events remain to be found. To obtain insights into the mechanism, we performed 38.5 microseconds of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of kinesin-MT complexes in different nucleotide states. Local subdomain dynamics were found to be essential for nucleotide processing. Catalytic water molecules are dynamically organized by the switch domains of the nucleotide binding pocket while ATP is torsionally strained. Hydrolysis products are 'pulled' by switch-I, and a new ATP is 'captured' by a concerted motion of the α0/L5/switch-I trio. The dynamic and wet kinesin-MT interface is tuned for rapid interactions while maintaining specificity. The proposed mechanism provides the flexibility necessary for walking in the crowded cellular environment.
          , 
            Motor proteins called kinesins perform a number of different roles inside cells, including transporting cargo and organizing filaments called microtubules to generate the force needed for a cell to divide. Kinesins move along the microtubules, with different kinesins moving in different ways: some ‘walk’, some jump, and some destroy the microtubule as they travel along it. All kinesins power their movements using the same molecule as fuel – adenosine triphosphate, known as ATP for short.
            Energy stored in ATP is released by a chemical reaction known as hydrolysis, which uses water to break off specific parts of the ATP molecule. The site to which ATP binds in a kinesin has a similar structure to the ATP binding site of many other proteins that use ATP. However, little was known about the way in which kinesin uses ATP as a fuel, including how ATP binds to kinesin and is hydrolyzed, and how the products of hydrolysis are released. These events are used to power the motor protein.
            Hwang et al. have used powerful computer simulation methods to examine in detail how ATP interacts with kinesin whilst moving across a microtubule. The simulations suggest that regions (or 'domains') of kinesin near the ATP binding site move around to help in processing ATP. These kinesin domains trap a nearby ATP molecule from the environment and help to deliver water molecules to ATP for hydrolysis. Hwang et al. also found that the domain motion subsequently helps in the release of the hydrolysis products by kinesin.
            The domains around the ATP pocket vary among the kinesins and these differences may enable kinesins to fine-tune how they use ATP to move. Further investigations will help us understand why different kinesin families behave differently. They will also contribute to exploring how kinesin inhibitors might be used as anti-cancer drugs.},

	abstract = {Hsp90 is a homodimeric ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that remodels its substrate ‘client’ proteins, facilitating their folding and activating them for biological function. Despite decades of research, the mechanism connecting ATP hydrolysis and chaperone function remains elusive. Particularly puzzling has been the apparent lack of cooperativity in hydrolysis of the ATP in each protomer. A crystal structure of the mitochondrial Hsp90, TRAP1, revealed that the catalytically active state is closed in a highly strained asymmetric conformation. This asymmetry, unobserved in other Hsp90 homologs, is due to buckling of one of the protomers and is most pronounced at the broadly conserved client-binding region. Here, we show that rather than being cooperative or independent, ATP hydrolysis on the two protomers is sequential and deterministic. Moreover, dimer asymmetry sets up differential hydrolysis rates for each protomer, such that the buckled conformation favors ATP hydrolysis. Remarkably, after the first hydrolysis, the dimer undergoes a flip in the asymmetry while remaining in a closed state for the second hydrolysis. From these results, we propose a model where direct coupling of ATP hydrolysis and conformational flipping rearranges client-binding sites, providing a paradigm of how energy from ATP hydrolysis can be used for client remodeling.},

There is also no consensus on whether tubulin is a peripheral membrane protein or is integrated into the outer mitochondrial membrane. Here the results of five independent techniques—surface plasmon resonance, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, bilayer overtone analysis, neutron reflectometry, and molecular dynamics simulations—suggest that α-tubulin’s amphipathic helix H10 is responsible for peripheral binding of dimeric tubulin to biomimetic “mitochondrial” membranes in a manner that differentiates between the two primary lipid headgroups found in mitochondrial membranes, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. The identification of the tubulin dimer orientation and membrane-binding domain represents an essential step toward our understanding of the complex mechanisms by which tubulin interacts with integral proteins of the mitochondrial outer membrane and is important for the structure-inspired design of tubulin-targeting agents.},

We performed an intragenic screen for suppressors of lethality induced by expression of Synaptotagmin C2B Ca2+-binding mutants in Drosophila. This screen uncovered essential residues within Synaptotagmin that suggest a structural basis for several activities required for fusion, including a C2B surface implicated in SNARE complex interaction that is required for rapid synchronization and Ca2+ cooperativity of vesicle release. Using electrophysiological, morphological and computational characterization of these mutants, we propose a sequence of molecular interactions mediated by Synaptotagmin that promote Ca2+ activation of the synaptic vesicle fusion machinery.},

Only a few hundreds of protein kinases regulate key processes in human cells, and protein kinases play a pivotal role in health and disease. The present study dwells on understanding the working of the protein kinase-molecular switch as an allosteric network of “communities” composed of congruently dynamic residues that make up the protein kinase core. Girvan–Newman algorithm-based community maps of the kinase domain of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A allow for a molecular explanation for the role of protein conformational entropy in its catalytic cycle. The community map of a mutant, Y204A, is analyzed vis-à-vis the wild-type protein to study the perturbations in its dynamic profile such that it interferes with transfer of the γ-phosphate to a protein substrate. Conventional biochemical measurements are used to ascertain the effect of these dynamic perturbations on the kinetic profiles of both proteins. These studies pave the way for understanding how mutations far from the kinase active site can alter its dynamic properties and catalytic function even when major structural perturbations are not obvious from static crystal structures.},

              IBNtxA, a morphine derivative, is 10-fold more potent and has a better safety profile than morphine. Animal studies indicate that the analgesic effect of IBNtxA appears to be mediated by the activation of truncated splice variants (6TM) of the Mu opioid receptor (MOR-1) where transmembrane helix 1 (TM1) is removed. Interestingly, morphine is unable to activate 6TM variants. To date, a high resolution structure of 6TM variants is missing, and the interaction of 6TM variants with IBNtxA and morphine remains elusive. In this study we used homology modeling, docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study a representative 6TM variant (G1) and a full-length 7TM variant of human MOR-1 in complex with IBNtxA and morphine respectively. The structural models of human G1 and 7TM were obtained by homology modeling using the X-ray solved crystal structure of the active mouse 7TM bound to an agonist BU72 (PDB id: 5C1M) as the template. Our 6000 ns MD data show that either TM1 truncation (
              i.e.
              from 7TM to 6TM) or ligand modification (
              i.e.
              from morphine to IBNtxA) alone causes the loss of key morphine–7TM interactions that are well-known to be required for MOR-1 activation. Receptor disruptions are mainly located at TMs 2, 3, 6 and 7 in comparison with the active crystal complex. However, when both perturbations occur in the 6TM–IBNtxA complex, the key ligand–receptor interactions and the receptor conformation are recovered to resemble those in the active 7TM–morphine complex. Our molecular switch analysis further explains well why morphine is not able to activate 6TM variants. The close resemblance between 6TM–IBTtxA and 7TM in complex with PZM21, a G-protein biased 7TM agonist, suggests the possible biased agonism of IBNtxA on G1, which is consistent with its reduced side effects.},

Here, molecular dynamics simulations totaling 30 μs on two nascent HDLs, each with 2 APOA1 and either 160 phospholipids and 24 cholesterols or 200 phospholipids and 20 cholesterols, show that residues 1–21 of the N-terminal domains of APOA1 interact via strong salt bridges. Residues 26–43 of one APOA1 in the smaller particle form a hinge on the disc edge, which displaces the C-terminal domain of the other APOA1 to the phospholipid surface. The proposed structures are supported by chemical cross-linking, Rosetta modeling of the N-terminal domain, and analysis of the lipid-free ∆185APOA1 crystal structure. These structures provide a framework for understanding HDL maturation and revise all previous models of nascent HDL.},

            Abstract
            Understanding the conformational dynamics of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)–Cas9 is of the utmost importance for improving its genome editing capability. Here, molecular dynamics simulations performed using Anton-2 – a specialized supercomputer capturing micro-to-millisecond biophysical events in real time and at atomic-level resolution – reveal the activation process of the endonuclease Cas9 toward DNA cleavage. Over the unbiased simulation, we observe that the spontaneous approach of the catalytic domain HNH to the DNA cleavage site is accompanied by a remarkable structural remodeling of the recognition (REC) lobe, which exerts a key role for DNA cleavage. Specifically, the significant conformational changes and the collective conformational dynamics of the REC lobe indicate a mechanism by which the REC1–3 regions ‘sense’ nucleic acids, ‘regulate’ the HNH conformational transition, and ultimately ‘lock’ the HNH domain at the cleavage site, contributing to its catalytic competence. By integrating additional independent simulations and existing experimental data, we provide a solid validation of the activated HNH conformation, which had been so far poorly characterized, and we deliver a comprehensive understanding of the role of REC1–3 in the activation process. Considering the importance of the REC lobe in the specificity of Cas9, this study poses the basis for fully understanding how the REC components control the cleavage of off-target sequences, laying the foundation for future engineering efforts toward improved genome editing.},

The insertion and assembly of β-barrel outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) is mediated by the β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex, the core component of which is the 16-stranded transmembrane β-barrel BamA. Recent studies have indicated a possible role played by the seam between the first and last β-barrel strands of BamA in the OMP insertion process through lateral gating and a destabilized membrane region. In this study, we have determined the stability and dynamics of the lateral gate through over 12.5 μs of equilibrium simulations and 4 μs of free-energy calculations. From the equilibrium simulations, we have identified a persistent kink in the C-terminal strand and observed spontaneous lateral-gate separation in a mimic of the native bacterial outer membrane. Free-energy calculations of lateral gate opening revealed a significantly lower barrier to opening in the C-terminal kinked conformation; mutagenesis experiments confirm the relevance of C-terminal kinking to BamA structure and function.},

	abstract = {Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) mediates viral entry into host cells through a large-scale conformational rearrangement at low pH that leads to fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes. Crystallographic and biochemical data suggest that a loop-to-coiled-coil transition of the B-loop region of HA is important for driving this structural rearrangement. However, the microscopic picture for this proposed “spring-loaded” movement is missing. In this study, we focus on understanding the transition of the B loop and perform a set of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the full B-loop trimeric structure with the CHARMM36 force field. The free-energy profile constructed from our simulations describes a B loop that stably folds half of the postfusion coiled coil in tens of microseconds, but the full coiled coil is unfavorable. A buried hydrophilic residue, Thr59, is implicated in destabilizing the coiled coil. Interestingly, this conserved threonine is the only residue in the B loop that strictly differentiates between the group 1 and 2 HA molecules. Microsecond-scale constant temperature simulations revealed that kinetic traps in the structural switch of the B loop can be caused by nonnative, intramonomer, or intermonomer β-sheets. The addition of the A helix stabilized the postfusion state of the B loop, but introduced the possibility for further β-sheet structures. Overall, our results do not support a description of the B loop in group 2 HAs as a stiff spring, but, rather, it allows for more structural heterogeneity in the placement of the fusion peptides during the fusion process.},

	abstract = {Neutron reflectivity (NR) has emerged as a powerful technique to study the structure and behavior of membrane proteins at planar lipid interfaces. Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) remain a significant challenge for NR owing to the difficulty of forming complete bilayers with sufficient protein density for scattering techniques. One strategy to achieve high protein density on a solid substrate is the capture of detergent-stabilized, affinity-tagged IMPs on a nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-functionalized self-assembled monolayer (SAM), followed by reconstitution into the lipids of interest. Such protein-tethered bilayer lipid membranes (ptBLMs) have the notable advantage of a uniform IMP orientation on the substrate. Here, NR is used to provide a structural characterization of the ptBLM process from formation of the SAM to capture of the detergent-stabilized IMP and lipid reconstitution. The mitochondrial outer-membrane voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), which controls the exchange of bioenergetic metabolites between mitochondria and the cytosol, was used as a model β-barrel IMP. Molecular dynamics simulations were used for comparison with the experimental results and to inform the parameters of the physical models describing the NR data. The detailed structure of the SAM is shown to depend on the density of the NTA chelating groups. The relative content of detergent and protein in surface-immobilized, detergent-stabilized VDAC is measured, while the reconstituted lipid bilayer is shown to be complete to within a few percent, using the known atomic structure of VDAC. Finally, excess lipid above the reconstituted bilayer, which is of consequence for more indirect structural and functional studies, is shown to be present.},

Dehydration upon folding can be characterized directly by all-atom simulations of fast pressure drops, which create desolvated pockets inside the nascent hydrophobic core. Here, we study pressure-drop refolding of three λ-repressor fragment (λ
              6–85
              ) mutants computationally and experimentally. The three mutants report on tertiary structure formation via different fluorescent helix–helix contact pairs. All-atom simulations of pressure drops capture refolding and unfolding of all three mutants by a similar mechanism, thus validating the nonperturbative nature of the fluorescent contact probes. Analysis of simulated interprobe distances shows that the α-helix 1–3 pair distance displays a slower characteristic time scale than the 1–2 or 3–2 pair distance. To see whether slow packing of α-helices 1 and 3 is reflected in the rate-limiting folding step, fast pressure-drop relaxation experiments captured refolding on a millisecond time scale. These experiments reveal that refolding monitored by 1–3 contact formation indeed is much slower than when monitored by 1–2 or 3–2 contact formation. Unlike the case of the two-state folder [three–α-helix bundle (α
              3
              D)], whose drying and core formation proceed in concert, λ
              6–85
              repeatedly dries and rewets different local tertiary contacts before finally forming a solvent-excluded core, explaining the non–two-state behavior observed during refolding in molecular dynamics simulations. This work demonstrates that proteins can explore desolvated pockets and dry globular states numerous times before reaching the native conformation.},

These class A G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are involved in mammalian signaling pathways and control cell migration toward endogenous CC chemokine ligands, named for the adjacent cysteine motif on their N terminus. Chemokine receptors and their associated ligands are involved in a wide range of diseases and thus have become important drug targets. CCR2, in particular, promotes the metastasis of cancer cells and is also implicated in autoimmunity-driven type-1 diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, multiple sclerosis, asthma, atherosclerosis, neuropathic pain, and rheumatoid arthritis. Although promising, CCR2 antagonists have been largely unsuccessful to date. Here, we investigate the effect of an orthosteric and an allosteric antagonist on CCR2 dynamics by coupling long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations with Markov-state model theory. We find that the antagonists shift CCR2 into several stable inactive conformations that are distinct from the crystal structure conformation and disrupt a continuous internal water and sodium ion pathway, preventing transitions to an active-like state. Several metastable conformations present a cryptic drug-binding pocket near the allosteric site that may be amenable to targeting with small molecules. Without antagonists, the apo dynamics reveal intermediate conformations along the activation pathway that provide insight into the basal dynamics of CCR2 and may also be useful for future drug design.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Myxovirus resistance protein B (MxB) is an interferon-inducible restriction factor of HIV-1 that blocks nuclear import of the viral genome. Evidence suggests that MxB recognizes higher-order interfaces of the HIV capsid lattice, but the mechanistic details of this interaction are not known. Previous studies have mapped the restriction activity of MxB to its N-terminus encompassing a triple arginine motif

            RRR
            13
            . Here we demonstrate a direct and specific interaction between the MxB N-terminus and helical assemblies of HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) using highly purified recombinant proteins. We performed thorough mutagenesis to establish the detailed molecular requirements for the CA interaction with MxB. The results map MxB binding to the interface of three CA hexamers, specifically interactions between positively charged MxB N-terminal residues and negatively charged CA residues. Our crystal structures show that the CA mutations affecting MxB interaction and restriction do not alter the conformation of capsid assembly. In addition, 30 microsecond long all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the complex between the MxB N-terminus and the HIV CA tri-hexamer interface show persistent MxB binding and identify a MxB-binding pocket surrounded by three CA hexamers. These results establish the molecular details of the binding of a lattice-sensing host factor onto HIV capsid, and provide insight into how MxB recognizes HIV capsid for the restriction of HIV-1 infection.
          
          
            Author summary
            The human antiviral protein MxB is a restriction factor that fights HIV infection. Previous experiments have demonstrated that MxB targets the HIV capsid, a protein shell that protects the viral genome. To make the conical shaped capsid, HIV CA proteins are organized into a lattice composed of hexamer and pentamer building blocks, providing many interfaces for host proteins to recognize. Through extensive biochemical and biophysical studies and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that MxB is targeting the HIV capsid by recognizing the region created at the intersection of three CA hexamers. We are further able to map this interaction to a few CA residues, located in a negatively-charged well at the interface between the three CA hexamers. This work provides detailed residue-level mapping of the targeted capsid interface and how MxB interacts. This information could inspire the development of capsid-targeting therapies for HIV.},

Structure-function studies show that the voltage-sensor of HCN channels are unique but the mechanisms that determine gating polarity remain poorly understood. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations ({\textasciitilde}20 μs) of HCN1 channel under hyperpolarization reveals an initial downward movement of the S4 voltage-sensor but following the transfer of last gating charge, the S4 breaks into two sub-helices with the lower sub-helix becoming parallel to the membrane. Functional studies on bipolar channels show that the gating polarity strongly correlates with helical turn propensity of the substituents at the breakpoint. Remarkably, in a proto-HCN background, the replacement of breakpoint serine with a bulky hydrophobic amino acid is sufficient to completely flip the gating polarity from inward to outward-rectifying. Our studies reveal an unexpected mechanism of inward rectification involving a linker sub-helix emerging from HCN S4 during hyperpolarization.},

            The self-assembly and fibrillation of amyloid β (Aβ) proteins is the neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. However, the molecular mechanism of how disordered monomers assemble into aggregates remains largely unknown. In this work, we characterize the assembly of Aβ (1–40) monomers into dimers using long-time molecular dynamics simulations. Upon interaction, the monomers undergo conformational transitions, accompanied by change of the structure, leading to the formation of a stable dimer. The dimers are stabilized by interactions in the N-terminal region (residues 5–12), in the central hydrophobic region (residues 16–23), and in the C-terminal region (residues 30–40); with inter-peptide interactions focused around the N- and C-termini. The dimers do not contain long β-strands that are usually found in fibrils.},

	abstract = {Two mechanisms have been proposed for the function of motor proteins: The power stroke and the Brownian ratchet. The former refers to generation of a large downhill free energy gradient over which the motor protein moves nearly irreversibly in making a step, whereas the latter refers to biasing or rectifying the diffusive motion of the motor. Both mechanisms require input of free energy, which generally involves the processing of an ATP (adenosine 5′-triphosphate) molecule. Recent advances in experiments that reveal the details of the stepping motion of motor proteins, together with computer simulations of atomistic structures, have provided greater insights into the mechanisms. Here, we compare the various models of the power stroke and the Brownian ratchet that have been proposed. The 2 mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and various motor proteins employ them to different extents to perform their biological function. As examples, we discuss linear motor proteins Kinesin-1 and myosin-V, and the rotary motor F

            Mechanosensitive Piezo1 and Piezo2 channels transduce various forms of mechanical forces into cellular signals that play vital roles in many important biological processes in vertebrate organisms. Besides mechanical forces, Piezo1 is selectively activated by micromolar concentrations of the small molecule Yoda1 through an unknown mechanism. Here, using a combination of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we identify an allosteric Yoda1 binding pocket located in the putative mechanosensory domain, approximately 40 Å away from the central pore. Our simulations further indicate that the presence of the agonist correlates with increased tension-induced motions of the Yoda1-bound subunit. Our results suggest a model wherein Yoda1 acts as a molecular wedge, facilitating force-induced conformational changes, effectively lowering the channel’s mechanical threshold for activation. The identification of an allosteric agonist binding site in Piezo1 channels will pave the way for the rational design of future Piezo modulators with clinical value.},

Here, we combined computational electrophysiology with Markov state model analysis to investigate how SF-level gating modalities control selective cation transport in wild-type (WT) and mutant (N629D) hERG1 variants. Starting from the recently reported cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) open-state channel structure, multiple microseconds-long molecular-dynamics (MD) trajectories were generated using different cation configurations at the filter, voltages, electrolyte concentrations, and force-field parameters. Most of the K

              permeation events observed in hERG1-WT simulations occurred at microsecond timescales, influenced by the spontaneous dehydration/rehydration dynamics at the filter. The SF region displayed conductive, constricted, occluded, and dilated states, in qualitative agreement with the well-documented flickering conductance of hERG1. In line with mutagenesis studies, these gating modalities resulted from dynamic interaction networks involving residues from the SF, outer-mouth vestibule, P-helices, and S5–P segments. We found that N629D mutation significantly stabilizes the SF in a state that is permeable to both K

A ligand-dependent conformational change is thought to regulate IGF1R activity, but the nature of this change is unclear. We point out an underappreciated dimer in the crystal structure of the related Insulin Receptor (IR) with Insulin bound that allows direct comparison with unliganded IR and suggests a mechanism by which ligand regulates IR/IGF1R activity. We test this mechanism in a series of biochemical and biophysical assays and find the IGF1R ectodomain maintains an autoinhibited state in which the TMs are held apart. Ligand binding releases this constraint, allowing TM association and unleashing an intrinsic propensity of the intracellular regions to autophosphorylate. Enzymatic studies of full-length and kinase-containing fragments show phosphorylated IGF1R is fully active independent of ligand and the extracellular-TM regions. The key step triggered by ligand binding is thus autophosphorylation.},

	abstract = {The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a key role in regulating cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, and aberrant EGFR signaling is implicated in a variety of cancers. EGFR signaling is triggered by extracellular ligand binding, which promotes EGFR dimerization and activation. Ligand-binding measurements are consistent with a negatively cooperative model in which the ligand-binding affinity at either binding site in an EGFR dimer is weaker when the other site is occupied by a ligand. This cooperativity is widely believed to be central to the effects of ligand concentration on EGFR-mediated intracellular signaling. Although the extracellular portion of the human EGFR dimer has been resolved crystallographically, the crystal structures do not reveal the structural origin of this negative cooperativity, which has remained unclear. Here we report the results of molecular dynamics simulations suggesting that asymmetrical interactions of the two binding sites with the membrane may be responsible (perhaps along with other factors) for this negative cooperativity. In particular, in our simulations the extracellular domains of an EGFR dimer spontaneously lay down on the membrane in an orientation in which favorable membrane contacts were made with one of the bound ligands, but could not be made with the other. Similar interactions were observed when EGFR was glycosylated, as it is in vivo.},

	abstract = {The design of network architectures has become increasingly complex as the chips connected by inter-node networks have emerged as distributed systems in their own right, complete with their own on-chip networks. In Anton 2, a massively parallel special-purpose supercomputer for molecular dynamics simulations, we managed this complexity by reusing the on-chip network as a switch for inter-node traffic. This unified network approach introduces several design challenges. Maintaining fairness within the inter-node network is difficult, as each hop becomes a sequence of many on-chip routing decisions. We addressed this problem with an inverse-weighted arbiter that ensures fairness with low implementation costs. Balancing the load of inter-node traffic across the on-chip network is also critical, and we adopted an optimization approach to design an appropriate routing algorithm. Finally, the on-chip routers carry inter-node traffic, so they must implement inter-node virtual channels to avoid deadlock. In order to keep the routers small and fast, we developed a deadlock-free routing algorithm that reduces the number of virtual channels by one-third relative to previous approaches. The resulting Anton 2 network implementation efficiently utilizes its inter-node channels and provides low messaging latency, while occupying a modest amount of silicon area.},

Unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide one solution, but their computational expense is often prohibitive, motivating the development of enhanced sampling methods that accelerate conformational changes in a given direction, embodied in a collective variable. The accuracy of such methods is unclear for complex protein transitions, because obtaining unbiased MD data for comparison is difficult. Here, we use long-time scale, unbiased MD simulations of epidermal growth factor receptor kinase deactivation as a complex biological test case for two widely used methods—steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and the string method. We found that common collective variable choices, based on the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the entire protein, prevented the methods from producing accurate paths, even in SMD simulations on the time scale of the unbiased transition. Using collective variables based on the RMSD of the region of the protein known to be important for the conformational change, however, enabled both methods to provide a more accurate description of the pathway in a fraction of the simulation time required to observe the unbiased transition.},

	abstract = {Cancer by Enhanced Allosteric Activation
Cancer-associated, oncogenic mutations in kinases often result in increased catalytic activity. Although cancer-associated mutations in the HER3 member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases exist, this receptor has little, if any, catalytic activity. The four members of the EGFR family form homodimers or heterodimers; this dimerization is necessary for the kinase activity of the catalytically active members HER1, HER2, and HER4. In homodimeric structures, one kinase subunit functions as an allosteric activator and the other as the activated receiver. Littlefield et al. crystallized the kinase domain of HER1 in complex with the kinase domain of wild-type HER3 or HER3 with cancer-associated mutations. This analysis, along with in vitro biochemical kinase assays, showed that HER3 functioned as an activator in the heterodimer and that the mutations enhanced the interaction between HER3 and HER1, thereby augmenting the allosteric activator function of HER3. This study provides a rationale for targeting the heterodimer interface with HER3 in cancer associated with aberrant activity of this family of receptors.
The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) tyrosine kinases homo- and heterodimerize to activate downstream signaling pathways. HER3 is a catalytically impaired member of the HER family that contributes to the development of several human malignancies and is mutated in a subset of cancers. HER3 signaling depends on heterodimerization with a catalytically active partner, in particular epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (the founding family member, also known as HER1) or HER2. The activity of homodimeric complexes of catalytically active HER family members depends on allosteric activation between the two kinase domains. To determine the structural basis for HER3 signaling through heterodimerization with a catalytically active HER family member, we solved the crystal structure of the heterodimeric complex formed by the isolated kinase domains of EGFR and HER3. The structure showed HER3 as an allosteric activator of EGFR and revealed a conserved role of the allosteric mechanism in activation of HER family members through heterodimerization. To understand the effects of cancer-associated HER3 mutations at the molecular level, we solved the structures of two kinase domains of HER3 mutants, each in a heterodimeric complex with the kinase domain of EGFR. These structures, combined with biochemical analysis and molecular dynamics simulations, indicated that the cancer-associated HER3 mutations enhanced the allosteric activator function of HER3 by redesigning local interactions at the dimerization interface.
Cancer-associated mutations in the catalytically inactive receptor HER3 enhance its ability to activate other members of the human epidermal growth factor receptor family.

	abstract = {trans-autophosphorylation is among the most prevalent means of protein kinase activation, yet its molecular basis is poorly defined. In Toll-like receptor and interleukin-1 receptor signaling pathways, the kinase IRAK4 is recruited to the membrane-proximal adaptor MyD88 through death domain (DD) interactions, forming the oligomeric Myddosome and mediating NF-κB activation. Here we show that unphosphorylated IRAK4 dimerizes in solution with a KD of 2.5 μM and that Myddosome assembly greatly enhances IRAK4 kinase domain (KD) autophosphorylation at sub-KD concentrations. The crystal structure of the unphosphorylated IRAK4KD dimer captures a conformation that appears to represent the actual trans-autophosphorylation reaction, with the activation loop phosphosite of one IRAK4 monomer precisely positioned for phosphotransfer by its partner. We show that dimerization is crucial for IRAK4 autophosphorylation in vitro and ligand-dependent signaling in cells. These studies identify a mechanism for oligomerization-driven allosteric autoactivation of IRAK4 that may be general to other kinases activated by autophosphorylation.},

	abstract = {Until just a few years ago, it was not clear whether it would be possible to fold proteins using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent molecules, despite the insights that these simulations had yielded into other biological problems. This was not just because of the computational challenge of reaching folding time scales, typically microseconds to seconds or longer, but also because it was not generally accepted that the empirical energy functions (“force fields”) used were sufficiently accurate to locate the folded state as a global free-energy minimum. This has changed dramatically in the last 2 y, with the development by Shaw and coworkers of a special-purpose supercomputer, Anton, capable of running biomolecular MD simulations on a microsecond or even millisecond timescale (1). This group showed that, with only minor adjustments to existing force fields (2⇓–4), it was possible to fold 12 small, “fast-folding” proteins (1), which adopt their native structure in microseconds. At the time, it was still not clear, however, whether it would be possible to do the same for larger, slower-folding proteins (5, 6). In PNAS, Piana et al. report simulations of ubiquitin folding, which occurs in milliseconds (7). Their results not only extend the computationally accessible time scale for calculating equilibrium folding trajectories by 2–3 orders of magnitude but have a number of implications that can only be deduced from a comparison of fast and slow folding proteins.

Protein folding is now often described in terms of an energy landscape primarily determined by the formation of contacts present in the folded state (8), the key assumption underlying a …

When a small label was incorporated on the cytosolic interface of transmembrane helix 6 (Cys-265), 19F NMR spectra of the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) reconstituted in maltose/neopentyl glycol detergent micelles revealed two distinct inactive states, an activation intermediate state en route to activation, and, in the presence of a G protein mimic, a predominant active state. Analysis of the spectra as a function of temperature revealed that for all ligands, the activation intermediate is entropically favored and enthalpically disfavored. β2AR enthalpy changes toward activation are notably lower than those observed with rhodopsin, a likely consequence of basal activity and the fact that the ionic lock and other interactions stabilizing the inactive state of β2AR are weaker. Positive entropy changes toward activation likely reflect greater mobility (configurational entropy) in the cytoplasmic domain, as confirmed through an order parameter analysis. Ligands greatly influence the overall changes in enthalpy and entropy of the system and the corresponding changes in population and amplitude of motion of given states, suggesting a complex landscape of states and substates.},

	abstract = {Understanding the nature of the glass transition—the dramatic slowing of dynamics and eventual emergence of a disordered solid from a cooling liquid—is a fundamental challenge in physical science. A central characteristic of glass-forming liquids is a non-exponential main relaxation process. The extent of deviation from exponential relaxation typically becomes more pronounced on cooling. Theories that predict a growth of spatially heterogeneous dynamics as temperature is lowered can explain these observations. In apparent contradiction to these theories, however, some experiments suggest that certain substances—notably including the intensely studied molecular glass-former ortho-terphenyl (OTP)—have a main relaxation process whose shape is essentially temperature independent, even though other observables predicted to be correlated with the degree of dynamical heterogeneity are temperature dependent. Here we report the first simulations based on an atomistic model of OTP that reach equilibrium at temperatures well into the supercooled regime. We first show that the results of these simulations are in reasonable quantitative agreement with experimental data for several basic properties over a wide range of temperatures. We then focus on rotational relaxation, finding nearly exponential behavior at high temperatures with clearly increasing deviations as temperature is lowered. The much weaker temperature dependence observed in light-scattering experiments also emerges from the same simulation data when we calculate correlation functions similar to those probed experimentally; this highlights the diversity of temperature dependencies that can be obtained with different probes. Further analysis suggests that the temperature insensitivity observed in the light-scattering experiments stems from the dependence of these measurements on internal as well as rotational molecular motion. Within the temperature range of our OTP simulations, our results strongly suggest that this archetypal glass-former behaves as anticipated by theories of the glass transition that predict increasing non-exponentiality with cooling, and our simulations thus strengthen the evidence supporting such theories.},

Although both catalytically active and inactive conformations of EGFR kinase have been resolved crystallographically, experimental characterization of the transitions between these conformations remains difficult. Using unbiased, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we observed EGFR kinase spontaneously transition from the active to the so-called “Src-like inactive” conformation by way of two sets of intermediate conformations: One corresponds to a previously identified locally disordered state and the other to previously undescribed “extended” conformations, marked by the opening of the ATP-binding site between the two lobes of the kinase domain. We also simulated the protonation-dependent transition of EGFR kinase to another [“Asp-Phe-Gly-out” (“DFG-out”)] inactive conformation and observed similar intermediate conformations. A key element observed in the simulated transitions is local unfolding, or “cracking,” which supports a prediction of energy landscape theory. We used hydrogen–deuterium (H/D) exchange measurements to corroborate our simulations and found that the simulated intermediate conformations correlate better with the H/D exchange data than existing active or inactive EGFR kinase crystal structures. The intermediate conformations revealed by our simulations of the transition process differ significantly from the existing crystal structures and may provide unique possibilities for structure-based drug discovery.},

The extent to which the conclusions drawn from the analysis of such proteins, which fold on the microsecond timescale, apply to the millisecond or slower folding of naturally occurring proteins is, however, unclear. As a first attempt to address this outstanding issue, we examine here the folding of ubiquitin, a 76-residue-long protein found in all eukaryotes that is known experimentally to fold on a millisecond timescale. Ubiquitin folding has been the subject of many experimental studies, but its slow folding rate has made it difficult to observe and characterize the folding process through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Here we determine the mechanism, thermodynamics, and kinetics of ubiquitin folding through equilibrium atomistic simulations. The picture emerging from the simulations is in agreement with a view of ubiquitin folding suggested from previous experiments. Our findings related to the folding of ubiquitin are also consistent, for the most part, with the folding principles derived from the simulation of fast-folding proteins, suggesting that these principles may be applicable to a wider range of proteins.},

	abstract = {Cellular function requires biomolecules to undergo dynamic transitions that include folding, conformational rearrangements, and large-scale assembly. The result is a highly interdependent network of processes that is maintained by a balance of thermodynamic and kinetic factors. In molecular machines, each constituent biopolymer (i.e., a chain of residues) first folds to a low-energy configuration/ensemble. These ordered polymers can then assemble into sophisticated architectures, which undergo conformational transitions during function. In contrast to the dynamics of macroscopic machines, molecular-level processes are stochastic, where the molecular interactions that ensure structural integrity are weak (i.e., on the scale of energetic fluctuations from solvent). In this dynamic environment, biomolecules constantly fluctuate (1), and the extent of disorder is heterogeneous between residues. Inspired by this, in 2003, Miyashita et al. postulated that biomolecules may exploit disorder to accelerate functional kinetics (2). In their theoretical investigation of protein function, the authors found large levels of strain energy accumulate in isolated residues. The predicted level of strain exceeded the stability of most proteins under cellular conditions, suggesting that these highly-strained regions may locally unfold, or “crack.” By cracking, the molecule may gain configurational entropy and thereby reduce the strain-induced barrier (Fig. 1). Subsequently, many theoretical and computational investigations have found evidence of cracking during function. These studies have primarily used simplified models (3), with which millisecond-scale dynamics are computationally accessible. In contrast, simulations with explicit-solvent models are typically limited to nanoseconds, or occasionally microseconds (4, 5). Because cracking and large-scale rearrangements occur on relatively long timescales (microseconds to milliseconds), evidence of cracking with explicit-solvent models has been sparse. In PNAS, Shan et al. (6) report the most definitive evidence of …

The unexpected recent finding of asymmetric ectodomain dimer structures of Drosophila EGFR (dEGFR) suggests a possible structural basis for Her2 heterodimerization, but all available structures for dimers of human EGFR family ectodomains are symmetric. Here, we report results from long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations indicating that a single ligand is necessary and sufficient to stabilize the ectodomain interface of Her2 heterodimers, which assume an asymmetric conformation similar to that of dEGFR dimers.

	abstract = {Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are increasingly being used to describe the folding of individual proteins and protein domains at an atomic level of detail. Isolated protein domains, however, are rarely observed in vivo, where multidomain proteins and multimeric assemblies are far more common. It is clear that the folding of such proteins is often inextricably coupled with the process of dimerization; indeed, many protein monomers and protein domains are not stable in isolation, and fold to their native structures only when stabilized by interactions with other members of a protein complex. Here, we use equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with an aggregate simulation length of 4 ms to elucidate key aspects of the folding mechanism, and of the associated free-energy surface, of the Top7-CFr dimer, a 114-amino-acid protein homodimer with a mixed α/β structure. In these simulations, we observed a number of folding and unfolding events. Each folding event was characterized by the assembly of two unfolded Top7-CFr monomers to form a stable, folded dimer. We found that the isolated monomer is unstable but that, early in the folding pathway, nascent native structure is stabilized by contacts between the two monomer subunits. These contacts are in some cases native, as in an induced-folding model, and in other cases non-native, as in a fly-casting mechanism. Occasionally, folding by conformational selection, in which both subunits form independently before dimerization, was also observed. Folding then proceeds through the sequential addition of strands to the protein β sheet. Although the long-time-scale relaxation of the folding process can be well described by a single exponential, these simulations reveal the presence of a number of kinetic traps, characterized by structures in which individual strands are added in an incorrect order.},

An efficient execution schedule for these tasks can be difficult or impossible to determine in advance, however, if there is uncertainty as to when each task's input data will be available. Ideally, each task would run in direct response to the arrival of its input data, thus allowing the computation to proceed in a fine-grained event-driven manner. Realizing this ideal is difficult in practice, and typically requires sacrificing flexibility for performance. In Anton 2, a massively parallel special-purpose supercomputer for molecular dynamics simulations, we addressed this challenge by including a hardware block, called the dispatch unit, that provides flexible and efficient support for fine-grained event-driven computation. Its novel features include a many-to-many mapping from input data to a set of synchronization counters, and the ability to prioritize tasks based on their type. To solve the additional problem of using a fixed set of synchronization counters to track input data for a potentially large number of tasks, we created a software library that allows programmers to treat Anton 2 as an idealized machine with infinitely many synchronization counters. The dispatch unit, together with this library, made it possible to simplify our molecular dynamics software by expressing it as a collection of independent tasks, and the resulting fine-grained execution schedule improved overall performance by up to 16\% relative to a coarse-grained schedule for precisely the same computation.},

	abstract = {In molecular dynamics simulations, control over temperature and pressure is typically achieved by augmenting the original system with additional dynamical variables to create a thermostat and a barostat, respectively. These variables generally evolve on timescales much longer than those of particle motion, but typical integrator implementations update the additional variables along with the particle positions and momenta at each time step. We present a framework that replaces the traditional integration procedure with separate barostat, thermostat, and Newtonian particle motion updates, allowing thermostat and barostat updates to be applied infrequently. Such infrequent updates provide a particularly substantial performance advantage for simulations parallelized across many computer processors, because thermostat and barostat updates typically require communication among all processors. Infrequent updates can also improve accuracy by alleviating certain sources of error associated with limited-precision arithmetic. In addition, separating the barostat, thermostat, and particle motion update steps reduces certain truncation errors, bringing the time-average pressure closer to its target value. Finally, this framework, which we have implemented on both general-purpose and special-purpose hardware, reduces software complexity and improves software modularity.},

Experiments and simulations expose a remarkably complex pattern of structural changes that occur at the atomic level and from which the detailed network of residue–residue couplings associated with cooperative folding emerges. Such thermodynamic residue–residue couplings appear to be linked to the order of mechanistically significant events that take place during the folding process.

	abstract = {Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) comprise the major group of Ca2+-regulated kinases in plants and protists. It has long been assumed that CDPKs are activated, like other Ca2+-regulated kinases, by derepression of the kinase domain (KD). However, we found that removal of the autoinhibitory domain from Toxoplasma gondii CDPK1 is not sufficient for kinase activation. From a library of heavy chain-only antibody fragments (VHHs), we isolated an antibody (1B7) that binds TgCDPK1 in a conformation-dependent manner and potently inhibits it. We uncovered the molecular basis for this inhibition by solving the crystal structure of the complex and simulating, through molecular dynamics, the effects of 1B7–kinase interactions. In contrast to other Ca2+-regulated kinases, the regulatory domain of TgCDPK1 plays a dual role, inhibiting or activating the kinase in response to changes in Ca2+ concentrations. We propose that the regulatory domain of TgCDPK1 acts as a molecular splint to stabilize the otherwise inactive KD. This dependence on allosteric stabilization reveals a novel susceptibility in this important class of parasite enzymes.},

A growing number of time series datasets, however, involve many observables, often with the property that a given change typically affects only a few of the observables. We introduce a general statistical method that, given many noisy observables, detects points in time at which various subsets of the observables exhibit simultaneous changes in data distribution and explicitly identifies those subsets. Our work is motivated by the problem of identifying the nature and timing of biologically interesting conformational changes that occur during atomic-level simulations of biomolecules such as proteins. This problem has proved challenging both because each such conformational change might involve only a small region of the molecule and because these changes are often subtle relative to the ever-present background of faster structural fluctuations. We show that our method is effective in detecting biologically interesting conformational changes in molecular dynamics simulations of both folded and unfolded proteins, even in cases where these changes are difficult to detect using alternative techniques. This method may also facilitate the detection of change points in other types of sequential data involving large numbers of observables—a problem likely to become increasingly important as such data continue to proliferate in a variety of application domains.},

	abstract = {Many proteins can be partially or completely disordered under physiological conditions. Structural characterization of these disordered states using experimental methods can be challenging, since they are composed of a structurally heterogeneous ensemble of conformations rather than a single dominant conformation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations should in principle provide an ideal tool for elucidating the composition and behavior of disordered states at an atomic level of detail. Unfortunately, MD simulations using current physics-based models tend to produce disordered-state ensembles that are structurally too compact relative to experiments. We find that the water models typically used in MD simulations significantly underestimate London dispersion interactions, and speculate that this may be a possible reason for these erroneous results. To test this hypothesis, we create a new water model, TIP4P-D, that approximately corrects for these deficiencies in modeling water dispersion interactions while maintaining compatibility with existing physics-based models. We show that simulations of solvated proteins using this new water model typically result in disordered states that are substantially more expanded and in better agreement with experiment. These results represent a significant step toward extending the range of applicability of MD simulations to include the study of (partially or fully) disordered protein states.},

However, how the catalytic kinase domain integrates different signals and switches from an active to an inactive conformation remains incompletely understood. Here we identify an allosteric network of dynamically coupled amino acids in Src kinase that connects regulatory sites to the ATP- and substrate-binding sites. Surprisingly, reactants (ATP and peptide substrates) bind with negative cooperativity to Src kinase while products (ADP and phosphopeptide) bind with positive cooperativity. We confirm the molecular details of the signal relay through the allosteric network by biochemical studies. Experiments on two additional protein tyrosine kinases indicate that the allosteric network may be largely conserved among these enzymes. Our work provides new insights into the regulation of protein tyrosine kinases and establishes a potential conduit by which resistance mutations to ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors can affect their activity.},

We have studied the mechanism of affinity gain in a human B-cell lineage in which two main maturation pathways, diverging from a common ancestor, lead to three mature antibodies that neutralize a broad range of H1 influenza viruses. Previous work showed that increased affinity in the mature antibodies derives primarily from stabilization of the CDR H3 loop in the antigen-binding conformation. We have now used molecular dynamics simulations and existing crystal structures to identify potentially key maturation mutations, and we have characterized their effects on the CDR H3 loop and on antigen binding using further simulations and experimental affinity measurements, respectively. In the two maturation pathways, different contacts between light and heavy chains stabilize the CDR H3 loop. As few as two single-site mutations in each pathway can confer substantial loop stability, but none of them confers experimentally detectable stability on its own. Our results support models of the germinal center reaction in which two or more mutations can occur without concomitant selection and show how divergent pathways have yielded functionally equivalent antibodies.

	abstract = {Interactions that slow protein folding
As proteins fold, they diffuse over an energy barrier that separates unfolded and folded states. The transition path defines how a single protein crosses the barrier and so contains key information on the mechanism of folding. Transition paths have not yet been experimentally observed, but Chung et al. have discovered which structural features of the protein affect the duration of the transition. As the protein folds, non-native salt bridges form and break, slowing diffusion along the transition path.
Science, this issue p. 1504
Experimental, theoretical, and computational studies of small proteins suggest that interresidue contacts not present in the folded structure play little or no role in the self-assembly mechanism. Non-native contacts can, however, influence folding kinetics by introducing additional local minima that slow diffusion over the global free-energy barrier between folded and unfolded states. Here, we combine single-molecule fluorescence with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to discover the structural origin for the slow diffusion that markedly decreases the folding rate for a designed α-helical protein. Our experimental determination of transition path times and our analysis of the simulations point to non-native salt bridges between helices as the source, which provides a quantitative glimpse of how specific intramolecular interactions influence protein folding rates by altering dynamics and not activation free energies.
Single-molecule experiments and simulations show how molecular interactions can direct protein folding by slowing diffusion.

	abstract = {How a receptor transmits a signal
G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) transmit diverse external signals into the cell. When activated by an outside stimulus, they bind to a G protein inside the cell and accelerate exchange of a bound guanosine diphosphate (GDP) nucleotide for guanosine triphosphate, which initiates intercellular signaling. Dror et al. used atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations to show how GPCRs enhance GDP release. The G protein is dynamic and frequently adopts a conformation that exposes GDP even without the receptor bound. GPCR binding to this conformation favors an additional structural rearrangement that favors GDP release. The authors confirmed these predictions experimentally using double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy.
Science, this issue p. 1361
G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) relay diverse extracellular signals into cells by catalyzing nucleotide release from heterotrimeric G proteins, but the mechanism underlying this quintessential molecular signaling event has remained unclear. Here we use atomic-level simulations to elucidate the nucleotide-release mechanism. We find that the G protein α subunit Ras and helical domains—previously observed to separate widely upon receptor binding to expose the nucleotide-binding site—separate spontaneously and frequently even in the absence of a receptor. Domain separation is necessary but not sufficient for rapid nucleotide release. Rather, receptors catalyze nucleotide release by favoring an internal structural rearrangement of the Ras domain that weakens its nucleotide affinity. We use double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy and protein engineering to confirm predictions of our computationally determined mechanism.
Atomic-level simulations show how G protein–coupled receptors trigger G protein signaling.

The second is hardware for in-network reductions that supports over a thousand concurrent neighbourhood reductions per node and fast all-to-all global reductions. The third is a log-weight synchronization mechanism for multicast-reduce communication patterns that can be used to efficiently detect the completion of reduction operations when the number of summands is difficult to predict.

Here, we examine the extent to which the use of low-resolution information in the form of residue–residue contacts, which can often be inferred from bioinformatics or experimental studies, can accelerate the determination of protein structure in simulation. We incorporated sets of 62, 31, or 15 contact-based restraints in MD simulations of ubiquitin, a benchmark system known to fold to the native state on the millisecond timescale in unrestrained simulations. One-third of the restrained simulations folded to the native state within a few tens of microseconds—a speedup of over an order of magnitude compared with unrestrained simulations and a demonstration of the potential for limited amounts of structural information to accelerate structure determination. Almost all of the remaining ubiquitin simulations reached near-native conformations within a few tens of microseconds, but remained trapped there, apparently due to the restraints. We discuss potential methodological improvements that would facilitate escape from these near-native traps and allow more simulations to quickly reach the native state. Finally, using a target from the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiment, we show that distance restraints can improve simulation accuracy: In our simulations, restraints stabilized the native state of the protein, enabling a reasonable structural model to be inferred.},

	abstract = {Human ubiquitin has been extensively characterized using a variety of experimental and computational methods and has become an important model for studying protein dynamics. Nevertheless, it has proven difficult to characterize the microsecond time scale dynamics of this protein with atomistic resolution. Here we use an unbiased computer simulation to describe the structural dynamics of ubiquitin on the picosecond to millisecond time scale. In the simulation, ubiquitin interconverts between a small number of distinct states on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. We find that the conformations visited by free ubiquitin in solution are very similar to those found various crystal structures of ubiquitin in complex with other proteins, a finding in line with previous experimental studies. We also observe weak but statistically significant correlated motions throughout the protein, including long-range concerted movement across the entire β sheet, consistent with recent experimental observations. We expect that the detailed atomistic description of ubiquitin dynamics provided by this unbiased simulation may be useful in interpreting current and future experiments on this protein.},

Notably, ligand binding also induces EGFR oligomerization, but the structures and functions of the oligomers are poorly understood. Here, we use fluorophore localization imaging with photobleaching to probe the structure of EGFR oligomers. We find that at physiological epidermal growth factor (EGF) concentrations, EGFR assembles into oligomers, as indicated by pairwise distances of receptor-bound fluorophore-conjugated EGF ligands. The pairwise ligand distances correspond well with the predictions of our structural model of the oligomers constructed from molecular dynamics simulations. The model suggests that oligomerization is mediated extracellularly by unoccupied ligand-binding sites and that oligomerization organizes kinase-active dimers in ways optimal for auto-phosphorylation in trans between neighbouring dimers. We argue that ligand-induced oligomerization is essential to the regulation of EGFR signalling.},

Enhanced sampling methods, the aim of which is to increase the sampling efficiency of MD simulations, have thus been extensively employed. The effectiveness of such methods when applied to complex biological systems like proteins, however, has been difficult to establish because even enhanced sampling simulations of such systems do not typically reach time scales at which convergence is extensive enough to reliably quantify sampling efficiency. Here, we obtain sufficiently converged simulations of three proteins to evaluate the performance of simulated tempering, a member of a widely used class of enhanced sampling methods that use elevated temperature to accelerate sampling. Simulated tempering simulations with individual lengths of up to 100 μs were compared to (previously published) conventional MD simulations with individual lengths of up to 1 ms. With two proteins, BPTI and ubiquitin, we evaluated the efficiency of sampling of conformational states near the native state, and for the third, the villin headpiece, we examined the rate of folding and unfolding. Our comparisons demonstrate that simulated tempering can consistently achieve a substantial sampling speedup of an order of magnitude or more relative to conventional MD.},

Fragments typically have a weak binding affinity, however, making it challenging to experimentally characterize key binding properties, including binding sites, poses, and affinities. Direct simulation of the binding equilibrium by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide a computational route to characterize fragment binding, but this approach is so computationally intensive that it has thus far remained relatively unexplored. Here, we perform MD simulations of sufficient length to observe several different fragments spontaneously and repeatedly bind to and unbind from the protein FKBP, allowing the binding affinities, on- and off-rates, and relative occupancies of alternative binding sites and alternative poses within each binding site to be estimated, thereby illustrating the potential of long time scale MD as a quantitative tool for fragment-based drug discovery. The data from the long time scale fragment binding simulations reported here also provide a useful benchmark for testing alternative computational methods aimed at characterizing fragment binding properties. As an example, we calculated binding affinities for the same fragments using a standard free energy perturbation approach and found that the values agreed with those obtained from the fragment binding simulations within statistical error.},

	abstract = {Noncovalent interactions are of fundamental importance across the disciplines of           chemistry, materials science, and biology. Quantum chemical calculations on noncovalently           bound complexes, which allow for the quantification of properties such as binding energies           and geometries, play an essential role in advancing our understanding of, and building           models for, a vast array of complex processes involving molecular association or           self-assembly. Because of its relatively modest computational cost, second-order           Møller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) theory is one of the most widely used methods in quantum           chemistry for studying noncovalent interactions. MP2 is, however, plagued by serious           errors due to its incomplete treatment of electron correlation, especially when modeling           van der Waals interactions and π-stacked complexes. Here we present             spin-network-scaled MP2 (SNS-MP2), a new semi-empirical MP2-based           method for dimer interaction-energy calculations. To correct for errors in MP2, SNS-MP2           uses quantum chemical features of the complex under study in conjunction with a neural           network to reweight terms appearing in the total MP2 interaction energy. The method has           been trained on a new data set consisting of over 200 000 complete basis set           (CBS)-extrapolated coupled-cluster interaction energies, which are considered the gold           standard for chemical accuracy. SNS-MP2 predicts gold-standard binding energies of unseen           test compounds with a mean absolute error of 0.04 kcal mol−1 (root-mean-square           error 0.09 kcal mol−1), a 6- to 7-fold improvement over MP2. To the best of our           knowledge, its accuracy exceeds that of all extant density functional theory- and           wavefunction-based methods of similar computational cost, and is very close to the           intrinsic accuracy of our benchmark coupled-cluster methodology itself. Furthermore,           SNS-MP2 provides reliable per-conformation confidence intervals on the predicted           interaction energies, a feature not available from any alternative method.},

The application of such simulations to RNA structures, however, has proven more challenging, due in large part to the fact that the physical models (“force fields”) available for MD simulations of RNA molecules are substantially less accurate in many respects than those currently available for proteins. Here, we introduce an extensive revision of a widely used RNA force field in which the parameters have been modified, based on quantum mechanical calculations and existing experimental information, to more accurately reflect the fundamental forces that stabilize RNA structures. We evaluate these revised parameters through long-timescale MD simulations of a set of RNA molecules that covers a wide range of structural complexity, including single-stranded RNAs, RNA duplexes, RNA hairpins, and riboswitches. The structural and thermodynamic properties measured in these simulations exhibited dramatically improved agreement with experimentally determined values. Based on the comparisons we performed, this RNA force field appears to achieve a level of accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art protein force fields, thus significantly advancing the utility of MD simulation as a tool for elucidating the structural dynamics and function of RNA molecules and RNA-containing biological assemblies.},

This crystal structure, together with long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations, shows how MK-801 and memantine (a drug approved for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease) bind within the vestibule of the ion channel, promote closure of the ion channel gate and lodge between the M3-helix-bundle crossing and the M2-pore loops, physically blocking ion permeation.},

	abstract = {The pathways that G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands follow as they bind to or dissociate from their receptors are largely unknown. Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) is a GPCR activated by intramolecular binding of a tethered agonist peptide that is exposed by thrombin cleavage. By contrast, the PAR1 antagonist vorapaxar is a lipophilic drug that binds in a pocket almost entirely occluded from the extracellular solvent. The binding and dissociation pathway of vorapaxar is unknown. Starting with the crystal structure of vorapaxar bound to PAR1, we performed temperature-accelerated molecular dynamics simulations of ligand dissociation. In the majority of simulations, vorapaxar exited the receptor laterally into the lipid bilayer through openings in the transmembrane helix (TM) bundle. Prior to full dissociation, vorapaxar paused in metastable intermediates stabilized by interactions with the receptor and lipid headgroups. Derivatives of vorapaxar with alkyl chains predicted to extend between TM6 and TM7 into the lipid bilayer inhibited PAR1 with apparent on rates similar to that of the parent compound in cell signaling assays. These data are consistent with vorapaxar binding to PAR1 via a pathway that passes between TM6 and TM7 from the lipid bilayer, in agreement with the most consistent pathway observed by molecular dynamics. While there is some evidence of entry of the ligand into rhodopsin and lipid-activated GPCRs from the cell membrane, our study provides the first such evidence for a peptide-activated GPCR and suggests that metastable intermediates along drug binding and dissociation pathways can be stabilized by specific interactions between lipids and the ligand.},

The structure reveals the location of the salmeterol exosite, where sequence differences between β1AR and β2AR explain the high receptor-subtype selectivity. A structural comparison with the β2AR bound to the full agonist epinephrine reveals differences in the hydrogen-bond network involving residues Ser2045.43 and Asn2936.55.

	abstract = {Chaperonins (ubiquitous facilitators of protein folding) sequester misfolded proteins within an internal cavity, thus preventing protein aggregation during the process of refolding. GroEL, a tetradecameric bacterial chaperonin, is one of the most studied chaperonins, but the role of the internal cavity in the refolding process is still unclear. It has been suggested that rather than simply isolating proteins while they refold, the GroEL cavity actively promotes protein folding. A detailed characterization of the folding dynamics and thermodynamics of protein substrates encapsulated within the cavity, however, has been difficult to obtain by experimental means, due to the system’s complexity and the many steps in the folding cycle. Here, we examine the influence of the GroEL cavity on protein folding based on the results of unbiased, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We first verified that the computational setup, which uses a recently developed state-of-the-art force field that more accurately reproduces the aggregation propensity of unfolded states, could recapitulate the essential structural dynamics of GroEL. In these simulations, the GroEL tetradecamer was highly dynamic, transitioning among states corresponding to most of the structures that have been observed experimentally. We then simulated a small, unfolded protein both in the GroEL cavity and in bulk solution and compared the protein’s folding process within these two environments. Inside the GroEL cavity, the unfolded protein interacted strongly with the disordered residues in GroEL’s C-terminal tails. These interactions stabilized the protein’s unfolded states relative to its compact states and increased the roughness of its folding free-energy surface, resulting in slower folding compared to the rate in solution. For larger proteins, which are more typical GroEL substrates, we speculate that these interactions may allow substrates to more quickly escape kinetic traps associated with compact, misfolded states, thereby actively promoting folding.},

Using a repertoire of imaging technologies and simulations we reveal an extracellular head-to-head interaction through which ligand-free receptor polymer chains of various lengths assemble. The architecture of the head-to-head interaction prevents kinase-mediated dimerisation. The latter, afforded by mutation or intracellular treatments, splits the autoinhibited head-to-head polymers to form stalk-to-stalk flexible non-extended dimers structurally coupled across the plasma membrane to active asymmetric tyrosine kinase dimers, and extended dimers coupled to inactive symmetric kinase dimers. Contrary to the previously proposed main autoinhibitory function of the inactive symmetric kinase dimer, our data suggest that only dysregulated species bear populations of symmetric and asymmetric kinase dimers that coexist in equilibrium at the plasma membrane under the modulation of the C-terminal domain.},

Here, we report the results of atomic-level simulations in which we observed five protein–protein pairs repeatedly associate to, and dissociate from, their experimentally determined native complexes using a molecular dynamics (MD)–based sampling approach that does not make use of any prior structural information about the complexes. To study association mechanisms, we performed additional, conventional MD simulations, in which we observed numerous spontaneous association events. A shared feature of native association for these five structurally and functionally diverse protein systems was that if the proteins made contact far from the native interface, the native state was reached by dissociation and eventual reassociation near the native interface, rather than by extensive interfacial exploration while the proteins remained in contact. At the transition state (the conformational ensemble from which association to the native complex and dissociation are equally likely), the protein–protein interfaces were still highly hydrated, and no more than 20\% of native contacts had formed.},

Our ability to find and progress fragment hits could potentially be improved by enhancing our understanding of their binding properties, which to date has largely been based on tacit knowledge and reports from individual projects. In the work reported here, we systematically analyzed the molecular and binding properties of fragment hits using 489 published protein–fragment complexes. We identified a number of notable features that these hits tend to have in common, including preferences in buried surface area upon binding, hydrogen bonding and other directional interactions with the protein targets, structural topology, functional-group occurrence, and degree of carbon saturation. In the future, taking account of these preferences in designing and selecting fragments to screen against protein targets may increase the chances of success in fragment screening campaigns.},

	abstract = {The transformation of molecular binding events into cellular decisions is the basis of most biological signal transduction. A fundamental challenge faced by these systems is that reliance on protein–ligand chemical affinities alone generally results in poor sensitivity to ligand concentration, endangering the system to error. Here, we examine the lipid-binding pleckstrin homology and Tec homology (PH-TH) module of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk). Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and membrane-binding kinetic measurements, we identify a phosphatidylinositol (3–5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) sensing mechanism that achieves switch-like sensitivity to PIP3 levels, surpassing the intrinsic affinity discrimination of PIP3:PH binding. This mechanism employs multiple PIP3 binding as well as dimerization of Btk on the membrane surface. Studies in live cells confirm that mutations at the dimer interface and peripheral site produce effects comparable to that of the kinase-dead Btk in vivo. These results demonstrate how a single protein module can institute an allosteric counting mechanism to achieve high-precision discrimination of ligand concentration. Furthermore, this activation mechanism distinguishes Btk from other Tec family member kinases, Tec and Itk, which we show are not capable of dimerization through their PH-TH modules. This suggests that Btk plays a critical role in the stringency of the B cell response, whereas T cells rely on other mechanisms to achieve stringency.},

The constitutively active V617F mutant of JAK2 is prevalent in many bone marrow disorders, blood cancers, and autoimmune diseases, and is an important drug target. Structures have been determined for each of the four individual domains making up JAK2, and for certain pairs of these domains, but no structure of full-length JAK2 is available, and thus the mechanisms underlying JAK2 regulation and the aberrant activity of the V617F mutant have been incompletely understood. Here we propose structural models of full-length JAK2 in both its active and inactive forms. Construction of these models was informed by long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations. Subsequent mutagenesis experiments showed that mutations at the putative interdomain interfaces modulated JAK2 activity. The models provide a structural basis for understanding JAK2 autoinhibition and activation, and suggest that the constitutive activity of the V617F mutant may arise from a dual effect of destabilizing the inactive conformation and stabilizing the active conformation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The structure of Escherichia coli NhaA was recently determined, but its mechanisms of transport and pH regulation remain elusive. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of NhaA that, with existing experimental data, enabled us to propose an atomically detailed model of antiporter function. Three conserved aspartates are key to our proposed mechanism: Asp164 (D164) is the Na+-binding site, D163 controls the alternating accessibility of this binding site to the cytoplasm or periplasm, and D133 is crucial for pH regulation. Consistent with experimental stoichiometry, two protons are required to transport a single Na+ ion: D163 protonates to reveal the Na+-binding site to the periplasm, and subsequent protonation of D164 releases Na+. Additional mutagenesis experiments further validated the model.
Molecular dynamics simulations of a Na+/H+ antiporter allow the proposal of an atomically detailed model for the mechanism of ion transport, pH regulation, and cation selectivity.

Our verification methodology addressed this problem by using a hierarchy of RTL, architectural, and numerical simulations. Block- and chip-level RTL models were verified by means of extensive co-simulation with a detailed C++ architectural simulator, ensuring that the RTL models could perform the same molecular dynamics computations as the architectural simulator. The output of the architectural simulator was compared to a parallelized numerical simulator that produces bitwise identical results to Anton, and is fast enough to verify the long-term numerical stability of computations on Anton. These explicit couplings between adjacent levels of the simulation hierarchy created a continuous verification chain from molecular dynamics to individual logic gates.},

This frequently makes verification more difficult than necessary because logic that is intrinsically hard to verify, such as memories, counters and deep first-in, first-out (FIFO) structures, becomes immutable in the design. This paper proposes a new approach that exploits formal verification of conditional coverage points with the goal of early identification of hard-to-verify logic. We use the difficulty of formal verification problems as an early estimator of the verification complexity of a design. While traditional verification methods consider conditional coverage only in the design verification phase, we describe an approach that uses conditional coverage at a much earlier stage---the design phase, during which changes to the RTL code are still possible. The method is illustrated using real examples from the verification of an ASIC designed for a specialized supercomputer.},

	abstract = {Anton, a special-purpose parallel machine currently under construction, is the result of a significant hardware-software codesign effort that relied heavily on an architectural simulator. One of this simulator's many important roles is to support the development of embedded software (software that runs on Anton's ASICs), which is challenging for several reasons. First, the Anton ASIC is a heterogeneous multicore system-on-a-chip, with three types of embedded cores tightly coupled to special-purpose hardware units. Second, a standard 512-ASIC configuration contains a total of 6,656 distinct embedded cores, all of which must be explicitly modeled within the simulator. Third, a portion of the embedded software is dynamically generated at simulation time. This paper discusses the various ways in which the Anton simulator addresses these challenges. We use a hardware abstraction layer that allows embedded software source code to be compiled without modification for either the simulation host or the hardware target. We report on the effectiveness of embedding golden-model testbenches within the simulator to verify embedded software as it runs. We also describe our hardware-software cosimulation strategy for dynamically generated embedded software. Finally, we use a methodology that we refer to as concurrent mixed-level simulation to model embedded cores within massively parallel systems. These techniques allow the Anton simulator to serve as an efficient platform for embedded software development.},

	abstract = {Aquaporin 0 (AQP0), the most abundant membrane protein in mammalian lens fiber cells, not only serves as the primary water channel in this tissue but also appears to mediate the formation of thin junctions between fiber cells. AQP0 is remarkably less water permeable than other aquaporins, but the structural basis and biological significance of this low permeability remain uncertain, as does the permeability of the protein in a reported junctional form. To address these issues, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of water transport through membrane-embedded AQP0 in both its (octameric) junctional and (tetrameric) nonjunctional forms. From our simulations, we measured an osmotic permeability for the nonjunctional form that agrees with experiment and found that the distinct dynamics of the conserved, lumen-protruding side chains of Tyr-23 and Tyr-149 modulate water passage, accounting for the slow permeation. The junctional and nonjunctional forms conducted water equivalently, in contrast to a previous suggestion based on static crystal structures that water conduction is lost on junction formation. Our analysis suggests that the low water permeability of AQP0 may help maintain the mechanical stability of the junction. We hypothesize that the structural features leading to low permeability may have evolved in part to allow AQP0 to form junctions that both conduct water and contribute to the organizational structure of the fiber cell tissue and microcirculation within it, as required to maintain transparency of the lens.},

	abstract = {A molecular-level understanding of the function of a protein requires knowledge of both its structural and dynamic properties. NMR spectroscopy allows the measurement of generalized order parameters that provide an atomistic description of picosecond and nanosecond fluctuations in protein structure. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a complementary approach to the study of protein dynamics on similar time scales. Comparisons between NMR spectroscopy and MD simulations can be used to interpret experimental results and to improve the quality of simulation-related force fields and integration methods. However, apparent systematic discrepancies between order parameters extracted from simulations and experiments are common, particularly for elements of noncanonical secondary structure. In this paper, results from a 1.2 μs explicit solvent MD simulation of the protein ubiquitin are compared with previously determined backbone order parameters derived from NMR relaxation experiments [Tjandra, N.; Feller, S. E.; Pastor, R. W.; Bax, A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 12562−12566]. The simulation reveals fluctuations in three loop regions that occur on time scales comparable to or longer than that of the overall rotational diffusion of ubiquitin and whose effects would not be apparent in experimentally derived order parameters. A coupled analysis of internal and overall motion yields simulated order parameters substantially closer to the experimentally determined values than is the case for a conventional analysis of internal motion alone. Improved agreement between simulation and experiment also is encouraging from the viewpoint of assessing the accuracy of long MD simulations.},

	abstract = {As parallel algorithms and architectures drive the longest molecular dynamics (MD) simulations towards the millisecond scale, traditional sequential post-simulation data analysis methods are becoming increasingly untenable. Inspired by the programming interface of Google's MapReduce, we have built a new parallel analysis framework called HiMach, which allows users to write trajectory analysis programs sequentially, and carries out the parallel execution of the programs automatically. We introduce (1) a new MD trajectory data analysis model that is amenable to parallel processing, (2) a new interface for defining trajectories to be analyzed, (3) a novel method to make use of an existing sequential analysis tool called VMD, and (4) an extension to the original MapReduce model to support multiple rounds of analysis. Performance evaluations on up to 512 cores demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the HiMach framework on a Linux cluster.},

	abstract = {An effective special-purpose supercomputer for molecular dynamics (MD) requires much more than high-performance acceleration of computational kernels: such accelerators must be balanced with general-purpose computation and communication resources. Achieving this balance was a significant challenge in the design of Anton, a parallel machine that will accelerate MD simulations by several orders of magnitude. Anton executes its most computationally demanding calculations on a highly specialized, enormously parallel, but largely non-programmable high-throughput interaction subsystem (HTIS). Other elements of the simulation have a less uniform algorithmic structure, and may also change in response to future advances in physical models and simulation techniques. Such calculations are executed on Antonpsilas flexible subsystem, which combines programmability with the computational power required to avoid ldquoAmdahlpsilas Lawrdquo bottlenecks arising from the extremely high throughput of the HTIS. Antonpsilas flexible subsystem is a heterogeneous multiprocessor with 12 cores, each organized around a 128-bit data path. This subsystem includes hardware support for synchronization, data transfer and certain types of particle interactions, along with specialized instructions for geometric operations. All aspects of the flexible subsystem were designed specifically to accelerate MD simulations, and although it relies primarily on what may be regarded as ldquogeneral-purposerdquo processors, even this subsystem contains more application-specific features than many recently proposed ldquospecializedrdquo architectures.},

	doi = {10.1109/HPCA.2008.4658650},
	abstract = {Anton is a massively parallel special-purpose supercomputer designed to accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by several orders of magnitude, making possible for the first time the atomic-level simulation of many biologically important phenomena that take place over microsecond to millisecond time scales. The majority of the computation required for MD simulations involves the calculation of pairwise interactions between particles and/or gridpoints separated by no more than some specified cutoff radius. In Anton, such range-limited interactions are handled by a high-throughput interaction subsystem (HTIS). The HTIS on each of Antonpsilas 512 ASICs includes 32 computational pipelines running at 800 MHz, each producing a result on every cycle that would require approximately 50 arithmetic operations to compute on a general-purpose processor. In order to feed these pipelines and collect their results at a speed sufficient to take advantage of this computational power, Anton uses two novel techniques to limit inter- and intra-chip communication. The first is a recently developed parallelization algorithm for the range-limited N-body problem that offers major advantages in both asymptotic and absolute terms by comparison with traditional methods. The second is an architectural feature that processes pairs of points chosen from two point sets in time proportional to the product of the sizes of those sets, but with input and output volume proportional only to their sum. Together, these features allow Anton to perform pairwise interactions with very high throughput and unusually low latency, enabling MD simulations on time scales inaccessible to other general- and special-purpose parallel systems.},

In this paper, we introduce a new method for the parallelization of range-limited particle interactions that proves particularly suitable to MD applications. Because it applies not only to pairwise interactions but also to interactions involving three or more particles, the method can be used for evaluation of both nonbonded and bonded forces in a MD simulation. It requires less interprocessor data transfer than traditional spatial decomposition methods at all but the lowest levels of parallelism. It gains an additional practical advantage in certain commonly used interprocessor communication networks by distributing the communication burden more evenly across network links and by decreasing the associated latency. When used to parallelize MD, it further reduces communication requirements by allowing the computations associated with short-range nonbonded interactions, long-range electrostatics, bonded interactions, and particle migration to use much of the same communicated data. We also introduce certain variants of this method that can significantly improve the balance of computational load across processors.},

This article introduces a new method for the parallel evaluation of distance-limited pairwise particle interactions that significantly reduces the amount of data transferred between processors by comparison with traditional methods.

	abstract = {The evaluation of electrostatic energy for a set of point charges in a periodic lattice is a computationally expensive part of molecular dynamics simulations (and other applications) because of the long-range nature of the Coulomb interaction. A standard approach is to decompose the Coulomb potential into a near part, typically evaluated by direct summation up to a cutoff radius, and a far part, typically evaluated in Fourier space. In practice, all decomposition approaches involve approximations—such as cutting off the near-part direct sum—but it may be possible to find new decompositions with improved trade-offs between accuracy and performance. Here, we present the u-series, a new decomposition of the Coulomb potential that is more accurate than the standard (Ewald) decomposition for a given amount of computational effort and achieves the same accuracy as the Ewald decomposition with approximately half the computational effort. These improvements, which we demonstrate numerically using a lipid membrane system, arise because the u-series is smooth on the entire real axis and exact up to the cutoff radius. Additional performance improvements over the Ewald decomposition may be possible in certain situations because the far part of the u-series is a sum of Gaussians and can thus be evaluated using algorithms that require a separable convolution kernel; we describe one such algorithm that reduces communication latency at the expense of communication bandwidth and computation, a trade-off that may be advantageous on modern massively parallel supercomputers.},

Despite the remarkable success of AZD9291, its binding pose with EGFR T790M remains unclear. Here, we report unbiased, atomic-level molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in which spontaneous association of AZD9291 with EGFR kinases having WT and T790M mutant gatekeepers was observed. Simulation-generated structural models suggest that the binding pose of AZD9291 with T790M differs from its binding pose with the WT, and that AZD9291 interacts extensively with the gatekeeper residue (Met 790) in T790M but not with Thr 790 in the WT, which explains why AZD9291 binds T790M with higher affinity. The MD simulation-generated models were confirmed by experimentally determined EGFR/T790M complex crystal structures. This work may facilitate the rational design of drugs that can overcome resistance mutations to AZD9291, and more generally it suggests the potential of using unbiased MD simulation to elucidate small-molecule binding poses.},

	abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which in isolation do not adopt a well-defined tertiary structure but instead populate a structurally heterogeneous ensemble of interconverting states, play important roles in many biological pathways. IDPs often fold into ordered states upon binding to their physiological interaction partners (a so-called “folding-upon-binding” process), but it has proven difficult to obtain an atomic-level description of the structural mechanisms by which they do so. Here, we describe in atomic detail the folding-upon-binding mechanism of an IDP segment to its binding partner, as observed in unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. In our simulations, we observed over 70 binding and unbinding events between the α-helical molecular recognition element (α-MoRE) of the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of the measles virus nucleoprotein (NTAIL) and the X domain (XD) of the measles virus phosphoprotein complex. We found that folding-upon-binding primarily occurred through induced-folding pathways (in which intermolecular contacts form before or concurrently with the secondary structure of the disordered protein)—an observation supported by previous experiments—and that the transition state ensemble was characterized by formation of just a few key intermolecular contacts and was otherwise highly structurally heterogeneous. We found that when a large amount of helical content was present early in a transition path, NTAIL typically unfolded and then refolded after additional intermolecular contacts formed. We also found that, among conformations with similar numbers of intermolecular contacts, those with less helical content had a higher probability of ultimately forming the native complex than conformations with more helical content, which were more likely to unbind. These observations suggest that even after intermolecular contacts have formed, disordered regions can have a kinetic advantage over folded regions in the folding-upon-binding process.},

Automation makes feasible the processing of large numbers of protein conformations, such as those generated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and thus may help achieve the longstanding goal of incorporating protein flexibility into virtual screening workflows. Here, we present AutoPH4, a new automated method for generating pharmacophore models based on protein structures; we show that a virtual screening workflow incorporating AutoPH4 ranks compounds more accurately than any other pharmacophore-based virtual screening workflow for which results on a public benchmark have been reported. The strong performance of the virtual screening workflow indicates that the AutoPH4 component of the workflow generates high-quality pharmacophores, making AutoPH4 promising for use in future virtual screening workflows as well, such as ones that use conformations generated by MD simulations.},

The conformation of the bound SA varies substantially with HA sequence, and crystallographic evidence suggests that the bound SA is flexible, so it is difficult to predict from crystal structures which mutations are responsible for the change in HA binding preference. We performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of SA analogs binding to various HAs, and observed a dynamic equilibrium among structurally diverse receptor conformations, including novel conformations that have not been experimentally observed. Using one such novel conformation, we predicted—and subsequently confirmed with microscale thermophoresis experiments—a set of mutations that substantially increased an HA’s affinity for a human SA analog. This prediction could not have been inferred from existing crystal structures, suggesting that MD-generated HA-SA conformational ensembles could help researchers predict human-adaptive mutations, aiding in the surveillance of emerging pandemic threats.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In the MAPK pathway, which is implicated in many cancers, multiple K-Ras proteins are thought to assemble at the cell membrane with Ras-effector proteins from the Raf family. Here we propose an atomistic structural model for such an assembly. Our starting point was an asymmetric, GTP-mediated K-Ras dimer model, which we generated using unbiased molecular dynamics simulations and verified with mutagenesis experiments. Adding further K-Ras monomers in a head-to-tail fashion led to a compact helical assembly, a model we validated using electron microscopy and cell-based experiments. This assembly stabilizes K-Ras in its active state and presents composite interfaces to facilitate Raf binding. Guided by existing experimental data, we then positioned C-Raf, the downstream kinase MEK1, and accessory proteins (Galectin-3 and 14-3-3σ) on the helical assembly. The resulting Ras-Raf signalosome model offers an explanation for a large body of data on MAPK signaling.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Recently developed optimization methods can be used to select thousands or even millions of hyperparameters.

We argue that this overfitting results from using the standard hyperparameter optimization objective function. Here we present an alternative objective that is equivalent to a Probably Approximately Correct-Bayes (PAC-Bayes) bound on the expected out-of-sample error. We then devise an efficient gradient-based algorithm to minimize this objective; the proposed method has asymptotic space and time complexity equal to or better than other gradient-based hyperparameter optimization methods. We show that this new method significantly reduces out-of-sample error when applied to hyperparameter optimization problems known to be prone to overfitting.},

	abstract = {The physics-based molecular force field (PMFF) was developed by integrating a set of potential energy functions in which each term in an intermolecular potential energy function is derived based on experimental values, such as the dipole moments, lattice energy, proton transfer energy, and X-ray crystal structures. The term “physics-based” is used to emphasize the idea that the experimental observables that are considered to be the most relevant to each term are used for the parameterization rather than parameterizing all observables together against the target value. PMFF uses MM3 intramolecular potential energy terms to describe intramolecular interactions and includes an implicit solvation model specifically developed for the PMFF. We evaluated the PMFF in three ways. We concluded that the PMFF provides reliable information based on the structure in a biological system and interprets the biological phenomena accurately by providing more accurate evidence of the biological phenomena.},

	abstract = {Proteorhodopsin (PR) is a light-driven proton pump that is most notable for ushering in the discovery of an ever-increasing number of microbial retinal proteins that are at the forefront of fields such as optogenetics. Two variants, blue (BPR) and green (GPR) proteorhodopsin, have evolved to harvest light at different depths of the ocean. The color-tuning mechanism in PR is controlled by a single residue at position 105: in BPR it is a glutamine, whereas in GPR it is a leucine. Although the majority of studies on the spectral tuning mechanism in PR have focused on GPR, detailed understanding of the electronic environment responsible for spectral tuning in BPR is lacking. In this work, several BPR models were investigated using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations to obtain fundamental insights into the color tuning mechanism of BPR. We find that the molecular mechanism of spectral tuning in BPR depends on two geometric parameters, the bond length alternation and the torsion angle deviation of the all-trans-retinyl chromophore. Both parameters are influenced by the strength of the hydrogen-bonded networks in the chromophore-binding pocket, which shows how BPR is different from other microbial rhodopsins.},

For the glycosidic linkages, both simple model compounds and the full disaccharides with methylation at the reducing end were used for parameter optimization. The model compounds were chosen to be monomers or glycosidic-linked dimers of tetrahydropyran (THP) and tetrahydrofuran (THF). Target data for optimization included one- and two-dimensional potential energy scans of ω and the Φ/Ψ glycosidic dihedral angles in the model compounds and full disaccharides computed by quantum mechanical (QM) RIMP2/cc-pVQZ single point energies on MP2/6-31G(d) optimized structures. Also included in the target data are extensive sets of QM gas phase monohydrate water–saccharide interactions, dipole moments, and molecular polarizabilities for both model compounds and full disaccharides. The resulting polarizable model is shown to be in good agreement with a range of QM data, offering a significant improvement over the additive CHARMM36 carbohydrate force field, as well as experimental data including crystal structures and conformational properties of disaccharides and a trisaccharide in aqueous solution.},

A superior performance of a quantum mechanical (QM)-based thermodynamic cycle approach relative to a molecular mechanical (MM)-based one in application to the optimization of two pharmaceutical series was demonstrated. The QM-based model also provided insights into the source of poor solubility of the lead compounds, allowing the selection of the optimal strategies for chemical modification and formulation.

It was found that the uncertainty of the Ttr prediction displays an inverse dependence on the difference of slopes of the intersecting relative free energy curves—the lower the difference, the higher the uncertainty of Ttr prediction. The results demonstrated that the error of Ttr prediction is expected to be high (up to ∼260–270 K), especially at the temperature range close to ambient and above. The lowest uncertainty of Ttr prediction at room temperature is expected to be ∼50 K in the case of virtual forms being separated by 10 kJ/mol at 0 K.},

A number of virtual screening approaches have been previously developed to allow a selection of the most promising cocrystal formers (coformers) for an experimental follow-up. A significant drawback of those methods is related to the lack of accounting for the crystallinity contribution to cocrystal formation. To address this issue, we propose in this study two virtual coformer screening approaches based on a modern cloud-computing crystal structure prediction (CSP) technology at a dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) level. The CSP-based methods were for the first time validated on challenging cases of indomethacin and paracetamol cocrystallization, for which the previously developed approaches provided poor predictions. The calculations demonstrated a dramatic improvement of the virtual coformer screening performance relative to the other methods. It is demonstrated that the crystallinity contribution to the formation of paracetamol and indomethacin cocrystals is a dominant one and, therefore, should not be ignored in the virtual screening calculations. Our results encourage a broad utilization of the proposed CSP-based technology in the pharmaceutical industry as the only virtual coformer screening method that directly accounts for the crystallinity contribution.},

In this work we present a novel cloud-computing crystal structure prediction (CSP) platform with the capability of scheduling hundreds of thousands CPU cores and integrating cutting-edge computational chemistry algorithms. This new cloud-computing based CSP platform has been applied to three crystalline drug substances of increasing complexity. The lattice energies of the experimental crystal structures are all within 4.0 kJ/mol of the lowest energy predicted structures. On the basis of the results of this work, the algorithm improvement and the mass computational power of cloud computing can reduce the whole CSP process to just 1–3 weeks for Z′ = 1 systems and less than 5 weeks for significantly more complex systems. Furthermore, it is possible to simultaneously perform calculations for multiple molecules if desired. As a result of these improvements, CSP calculations can potentially be applied in conjunction with state-of-the-art experimental screening techniques to reduce the risk of finding new solid forms after product launch provided that a sufficient number of stoichiometries and space groups are explored.},

	abstract = {Progress in the development of GPU-accelerated free energy simulation software has enabled practical applications on complex biological systems and fueled efforts to develop more accurate and robust predictive methods. In particular, this work re-examines concerted (a.k.a., one-step or unified) alchemical transformations commonly used in the prediction of hydration and relative binding free energies (RBFEs). We first classify several known challenges in these calculations into three categories: endpoint catastrophes, particle collapse, and large gradient-jumps. While endpoint catastrophes have long been addressed using softcore potentials, the remaining two problems occur much more sporadically and can result in either numerical instability (i.e., complete failure of a simulation) or inconsistent estimation (i.e., stochastic convergence to an incorrect result). The particle collapse problem stems from an imbalance in short-range electrostatic and repulsive interactions and can, in principle, be solved by appropriately balancing the respective softcore parameters. However, the large gradient-jump problem itself arises from the sensitivity of the free energy to large values of the softcore parameters, as might be used in trying to solve the particle collapse issue. Often, no satisfactory compromise exists with the existing softcore potential form. As a framework for solving these problems, we developed a new family of smoothstep softcore (SSC) potentials motivated by an analysis of the derivatives along the alchemical path. The smoothstep polynomials generalize the monomial functions that are used in most implementations and provide an additional path-dependent smoothing parameter. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on simple yet pathological cases that illustrate the three problems outlined. With appropriate parameter selection, we find that a second-order SSC(2) potential does at least as well as the conventional approach and provides vast improvement in terms of consistency across all cases. Last, we compare the concerted SSC(2) approach against the gold-standard stepwise (a.k.a., decoupled or multistep) scheme over a large set of RBFE calculations as might be encountered in drug discovery.},

	abstract = {Biomolecular simulations are typically performed in an aqueous environment where the number of ions remains fixed for the duration of the simulation, generally with either a minimally neutralizing ion environment or a number of salt pairs intended to match the macroscopic salt concentration. In contrast, real biomolecules experience local ion environments where the salt concentration is dynamic and may differ from bulk. The degree of salt concentration variability and average deviation from the macroscopic concentration remains, as yet, unknown. Here, we describe the theory and implementation of a Monte Carlo osmostat that can be added to explicit solvent molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations to sample from a semigrand canonical ensemble in which the number of salt pairs fluctuates dynamically during the simulation. The osmostat reproduces the correct equilibrium statistics for a simulation volume that can exchange ions with a large reservoir at a defined macroscopic salt concentration. To achieve useful Monte Carlo acceptance rates, the method makes use of nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) moves in which monovalent ions and water molecules are alchemically transmuted using short nonequilibrium trajectories, with a modified Metropolis-Hastings criterion ensuring correct equilibrium statistics for an (Δμ, N, p, T) ensemble to achieve a ∼1046× boost in acceptance rates. We demonstrate how typical protein (DHFR and the tyrosine kinase Src) and nucleic acid (Drew–Dickerson B-DNA dodecamer) systems exhibit salt concentration distributions that significantly differ from fixed-salt bulk simulations and display fluctuations that are on the same order of magnitude as the average.},

However, mainstream vHTS tools have significant limitations: ligand-based methods depend on knowledge of existing chemical matter, while structure-based tools such as docking involve significant approximations that limit their accuracy. Recent advances in scientific methods coupled with dramatic speedups in computational processing with GPUs make this an opportune time to consider the role of more rigorous methods that could improve the predictive power of vHTS workflows. In this Perspective, we assert that alchemical binding free energy methods using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have matured to the point where they can be applied in virtual screening campaigns as a final scoring stage to prioritize the top molecules for experimental testing. Specifically, we propose that alchemical absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations offer the most direct and computationally efficient approach within a rigorous statistical thermodynamic framework for computing binding energies of diverse molecules, as is required for virtual screening. ABFE calculations are particularly attractive for drug discovery at this point in time, where the confluence of large-scale genomics data and insights from chemical biology have unveiled a large number of promising disease targets for which no small molecule binders are known, precluding ligand-based approaches, and where traditional docking approaches have foundered to find progressible chemical matter.},

	abstract = {Accurate in silico prediction of protein–ligand binding affinities has been a primary objective of structure-based drug design for decades due to the putative value it would bring to the drug discovery process. However, computational methods have historically failed to deliver value in real-world drug discovery applications due to a variety of scientific, technical, and practical challenges. Recently, a family of approaches commonly referred to as relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations, which rely on physics-based molecular simulations and statistical mechanics, have shown promise in reliably generating accurate predictions in the context of drug discovery projects. This advance arises from accumulating developments in the underlying scientific methods (decades of research on force fields and sampling algorithms) coupled with vast increases in computational resources (graphics processing units and cloud infrastructures). Mounting evidence from retrospective validation studies, blind challenge predictions, and prospective applications suggests that RBFE simulations can now predict the affinity differences for congeneric ligands with sufficient accuracy and throughput to deliver considerable value in hit-to-lead and lead optimization efforts. Here, we present an overview of current RBFE implementations, highlighting recent advances and remaining challenges, along with examples that emphasize practical considerations for obtaining reliable RBFE results. We focus specifically on relative binding free energies because the calculations are less computationally intensive than absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations and map directly onto the hit-to-lead and lead optimization processes, where the prediction of relative binding energies between a reference molecule and new ideas (virtual molecules) can be used to prioritize molecules for synthesis. We describe the critical aspects of running RBFE calculations, from both theoretical and applied perspectives, using a combination of retrospective literature examples and prospective studies from drug discovery projects. This work is intended to provide a contemporary overview of the scientific, technical, and practical issues associated with running relative binding free energy simulations, with a focus on real-world drug discovery applications. We offer guidelines for improving the accuracy of RBFE simulations, especially for challenging cases, and emphasize unresolved issues that could be improved by further research in the field.},

Conformational distribution, classical nucleation, and growth morphology theories were utilized, respectively, to compare the results with those of polymorphic systems, famotidine, nimodipine, paracetamol, indomethacin, tolfenamic acid, and mebendazole for which kinetic hindrance of the stable forms was not reported. The results did not support a potential mechanism of kinetic hindering of the stable polymorphic form due to nucleation and growth limited crystallization. However, a low population of crystallographic conformations of the stable forms in solution allowed us to distinguish the behavior of the late-appearing stable systems from other polymorphic systems. To account for the low crystallographic conformer population as the potential source for kinetic hindrance, we suggest that self-association of the monomeric active pharmaceutical ingredients molecules precedes over nucleation in solution. As an implication to crystal structure prediction studies, it is suggested to complement the analysis of the lattice energy landscape of conformational polymorphs by the prediction of crystallographic conformers distribution in the gas phase and in solvents of potential interest.},

To better understand the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, we performed computational alanine scanning mutagenesis on the “hotspot” residues at protein–protein interfaces using relative free energy calculations. Our data suggest that the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 lead to a greater binding affinity relative to SARS-CoV. In addition, our free energy calculations provide insight into the infectious ability of viruses on a physical basis and also provide useful information for the design of antiviral drugs.},

	abstract = {Predicting protein–ligand binding affinities and the associated thermodynamics of biomolecular recognition is a primary objective of structure-based drug design. Alchemical free energy simulations offer a highly accurate and computationally efficient route to achieving this goal. While the AMBER molecular dynamics package has successfully been used for alchemical free energy simulations in academic research groups for decades, widespread impact in industrial drug discovery settings has been minimal because of the previous limitations within the AMBER alchemical code, coupled with challenges in system setup and postprocessing workflows. Through a close academia-industry collaboration we have addressed many of the previous limitations with an aim to improve accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of alchemical binding free energy simulations in industrial drug discovery applications. Here, we highlight some of the recent advances in AMBER20 with a focus on alchemical binding free energy (BFE) calculations, which are less computationally intensive than alternative binding free energy methods where full binding/unbinding paths are explored. In addition to scientific and technical advances in AMBER20, we also describe the essential practical aspects associated with running relative alchemical BFE calculations, along with recommendations for best practices, highlighting the importance not only of the alchemical simulation code but also the auxiliary functionalities and expertise required to obtain accurate and reliable results. This work is intended to provide a contemporary overview of the scientific, technical, and practical issues associated with running relative BFE simulations in AMBER20, with a focus on real-world drug discovery applications.},

Our method not only reveals findings established by humans but also features that have not been recognized, showing higher accuracy than human in prognostic prediction. Combining both our algorithm-generated features and human-established criteria predicts the recurrence more accurately than using either method alone.

Basic concept behind IoT is to automate and communicate objects and things without human provided input. Objects communicate with each other via wireless communication devices like RFID. Information could be collected from information by using sensors and actuators. As communication between devices increases, need of an Operating System which communicates with heterogeneous devices also increases.

Recent works have explored learning beyond single-agent scenarios and have considered multiagent learning (MAL) scenarios. Initial results report successes in complex multiagent domains, although there are several challenges to be addressed. The primary goal of this article is to provide a clear overview of current multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MDRL) literature. Additionally, we complement the overview with a broader analysis: (i) we revisit previous key components, originally presented in MAL and RL, and highlight how they have been adapted to multiagent deep reinforcement learning settings. (ii) We provide general guidelines to new practitioners in the area: describing lessons learned from MDRL works, pointing to recent benchmarks, and outlining open avenues of research. (iii) We take a more critical tone raising practical challenges of MDRL (e.g., implementation and computational demands). We expect this article will help unify and motivate future research to take advantage of the abundant literature that exists (e.g., RL and MAL) in a joint effort to promote fruitful research in the multiagent community.},

Computer programs have shown superiority over humans in two-player games such as chess, Go, and heads-up, no-limit Texas hold'em poker. However, poker games usually include six players—a much trickier challenge for artificial intelligence than the two-player variant. Brown and Sandholm developed a program, dubbed Pluribus, that learned how to play six-player no-limit Texas hold'em by playing against five copies of itself (see the Perspective by Blair and Saffidine). When pitted against five elite professional poker players, or with five copies of Pluribus playing against one professional, the computer performed significantly better than humans over the course of 10,000 hands of poker.

In recent years there have been great strides in artificial intelligence (AI), with games often serving as challenge problems, benchmarks, and milestones for progress. Poker has served for decades as such a challenge problem. Past successes in such benchmarks, including poker, have been limited to two-player games. However, poker in particular is traditionally played with more than two players. Multiplayer games present fundamental additional issues beyond those in two-player games, and multiplayer poker is a recognized AI milestone. In this paper we present Pluribus, an AI that we show is stronger than top human professionals in six-player no-limit Texas hold’em poker, the most popular form of poker played by humans.
An AI dubbed Pluribus performs significantly better than human professionals in six-player no-limit Texas hold’em poker.

	abstract = {When placed over a less dense medium, a liquid layer will typically collapse downwards if it exceeds a certain size, as gravity acting on the lower liquid interface triggers a destabilizing effect called a Rayleigh–Taylor instability1,2. Of the many methods that have been developed to prevent the liquid from falling3–6, vertical shaking has proved to be efficient and has therefore been studied in detail7–13. Stabilization is the result of the dynamical averaging effect of the oscillating effective gravity. Vibrations of liquids also induce other paradoxical phenomena such as the sinking of air bubbles14–19 or the stabilization of heavy objects in columns of fluid at unexpected heights20. Here we take advantage of the excitation resonance of the supporting air layer to perform experiments with large levitating liquid layers of up to half a litre in volume and up to 20 centimetres in width. Moreover, we predict theoretically and show experimentally that vertical shaking also creates stable buoyancy positions on the lower interface of the liquid, which behave as though the gravitational force were inverted. Bodies can thus float upside down on the lower interface of levitating liquid layers. We use our model to predict the minimum excitation needed to withstand falling of such an inverted floater, which depends on its mass. Experimental observations confirm the possibility of selective falling of heavy bodies. Our findings invite us to rethink all interfacial phenomena in this exotic and counter-intuitive stable configuration.},

We argue that reference to a straightforward accumulation of evidence alone is inadequate to comprehend this episode. Rather, the rise of cosmological research, the accompanying renewed interest in the theory of relativity and changes in the manpower division of astronomy in the 1960s are key to understanding how dark matter came to matter.

The presence of PH3 is unexplained after exhaustive study of steady-state chemistry and photochemical pathways, with no currently known abiotic production routes in Venus’s atmosphere, clouds, surface and subsurface, or from lightning, volcanic or meteoritic delivery. PH3 could originate from unknown photochemistry or geochemistry, or, by analogy with biological production of PH3 on Earth, from the presence of life.

The technique allows simulation of realistic-size systems. Employing high-level ab initio data as a target for fitting allows us to avoid the problem of the lack of detailed experimental data. Using the fast and reliable quantum mechanical methods supplies robust fitting data for the resulting parameter sets. As a result, gas-phase many-body effects for dipeptides are captured within the average RMSD of 0.22 kcal/mol from their ab initio values, and conformational energies for the di- and tetrapeptides are reproduced within the average RMSD of 0.43 kcal/mol from their quantum mechanical counterparts. The latter is achieved in part because of application of a novel torsional fitting technique recently developed in our group, which has already been used to greatly improve accuracy of the peptide conformational equilibrium prediction with the OPLS-AA force field.1 Finally, we have employed the newly developed first-generation model in computing gas-phase conformations of real proteins, as well as in molecular dynamics studies of the systems. The results show that, although the overall accuracy is no better than what can be achieved with a fixed-charges model, the methodology produces robust results, permits reasonably low computational cost, and avoids other computational problems typical for polarizable force fields. It can be considered as a solid basis for building a more accurate and complete second-generation model. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 23: 1515–1531, 2002},

	abstract = {Kohn–Sham density functional theory (DFT) is the basis of modern computational approaches to electronic structures. Their accuracy heavily relies on the exchange-correlation energy functional, which encapsulates electron–electron interaction beyond the classical model. As its universal form remains undiscovered, approximated functionals constructed with heuristic approaches are used for practical studies. However, there are problems in their accuracy and transferability, while any systematic approach to improve them is yet obscure. In this study, we demonstrate that the functional can be systematically constructed using accurate density distributions and energies in reference molecules via machine learning. Surprisingly, a trial functional machine learned from only a few molecules is already applicable to hundreds of molecules comprising various first- and second-row elements with the same accuracy as the standard functionals. This is achieved by relating density and energy using a flexible feed-forward neural network, which allows us to take a functional derivative via the back-propagation algorithm. In addition, simply by introducing a nonlocal density descriptor, the nonlocal effect is included to improve accuracy, which has hitherto been impractical. Our approach thus will help enrich the DFT framework by utilizing the rapidly advancing machine-learning technique.},

By forming a weighted mean of the exchange charges, weighted and averaged over the various electronic wave functions at a given point of space, we set up an average potential field in which we can consider all of the electrons to move, thus leading to a great simplification of the Hartree-Fock method, and bringing it into agreement with the usual band picture of solids, in which all electron are assumed to move in the same field. We can further replace the average exchange charge by the corresponding value which we should have in a free-electron gas whose local density is equal to the density of actual charge at the position in question; this results in a very simple expression for the average potential field, which still behaves qualitatively like that of the Hartree-Fock method. This simplified field is being applied to problems in atomic structure, with satisfactory results, and is adapted as well to problems of molecules and solids.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Large-scale incidents such as the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, the 2011 European Escherichia coli outbreak, and Hurricane Sandy demonstrate the need for continuous improvement in emergency preparation, alert, and response systems globally. As questions relating to emergency preparedness and response continue to rise to the forefront, the field of industrial and systems engineering (ISE) emerges, as it provides sophisticated techniques that have the ability to model the system, simulate, and optimize complex systems, even under uncertainty.

Methods
We applied three ISE techniques—Markov modeling, operations research (OR) or optimization, and computer simulation—to public health emergency preparedness.

Results
We present three models developed through a four-year partnership with stakeholders from state and local public health for effectively, efficiently, and appropriately responding to potential public health threats: (1) an OR model for optimal alerting in response to a public health event, (2) simulation models developed to respond to communicable disease events from the perspective of public health, and (3) simulation models for implementing pandemic influenza vaccination clinics representative of clinics in operation for the 2009–2010 H1N1 vaccinations in North Carolina.

Conclusions
The methods employed by the ISE discipline offer powerful new insights to understand and improve public health emergency preparedness and response systems. The models can be used by public health practitioners not only to inform their planning decisions but also to provide a quantitative argument to support public health decision making and investment.},

Rapid and highly reliable screening of infection is urgently needed during the epidemic season at mass gathering places, such as airport quarantine facilities, public health centers, and hospital outpatients units, etc. To meet this need, our research group is currently developing a multiple vital-signs based infection screening system that can perform human medical inspections within 15 seconds. This system remotely monitors facial temperature, heart and respiration rates using a thermopile array and a 24-GHz microwave radar, respectively. In this work, we redesigned our previous system to make a higher performance with a user-friendly interface. Moreover, the system newly included a multivariable logistic regression model (MLRM) to determine the possibility of infection. We tested the system on 34 seasonal influenza patients and 35 normal control subjects at the Japan Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital. The sensitivity and specificity of the screening system using the MLRM were 85.3\% and 88.6\%, respectively.},

Significantly, our AI system identified important clinical markers that correlated with the NCP lesion properties. Together with the clinical data, our AI system was able to provide accurate clinical prognosis that can aid clinicians to consider appropriate early clinical management and allocate resources appropriately.

The way simulations are performed to explore the energy landscape of protein systems is also changing as force-fields are started to be designed by means of machine learning methods. These methods are also used to extract the essential information from large simulation datasets and to enhance the sampling of rare events such as folding/unfolding transitions. While significant challenges still need to be tackled, we expect these methods to play an important role on the study of protein folding and dynamics in the near future. We discuss here the recent advances on all these fronts and the questions that need to be addressed for machine learning approaches to become mainstream in protein simulation.},

Yet it has remained mysterious because of the experimental hurdles that beset the study of this developmental phase. Here, we establish an in vitro system to culture human embryos through implantation stages in the absence of maternal tissues and reveal the key events of early human morphogenesis. These include segregation of the pluripotent embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages, and morphogenetic rearrangements leading to generation of a bilaminar disc, formation of a pro-amniotic cavity within the embryonic lineage, appearance of the prospective yolk sac, and trophoblast differentiation. Using human embryos and human pluripotent stem cells, we show that the reorganization of the embryonic lineage is mediated by cellular polarization leading to cavity formation. Together, our results indicate that the critical remodelling events at this stage of human development are embryo-autonomous, highlighting the remarkable and unanticipated self-organizing properties of human embryos.},

	abstract = {Translated by Abdullah Yusuf Ali, 'The Holy Qur'an' (also known as The Koran) is the sacred book of Islam. It is the word of God whose truth was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel over a period of 23 years. As it was revealed, so it was committed to memory by his companions, though written copies were also made by literate believers during the lifetime of the Prophet. The first full compilation was by Abu Bakar, the first Caliph, and it was then recompiled in the original dialect by the third Caliph Uthman, after the best reciters had fallen in battle. Muslims believe that the truths of 'The Holy Qur'an' are fully and authentically revealed only in the original classical Arabic. However, as the influence of Islam grows and spreads to the modern world, it is recognised that translation is an important element in introducing and explaining Islam to a wider audience. This translation, by Abdullah Yusuf Ali, is considered to be the most faithful rendering available in English. TRANSLATOR: Hafiz Abdullah Yusuf Ali (14 April 1872 - 10 December 1953) was an Indian Islamic scholar who translated the Qur'an into English. His translation is one of the most widely-known and used in the English-speaking world. Ali was an outspoken supporter of the Indian contribution to the Allied effort in World War I. He was a respected intellectual in India and Sir Muhammad Iqbal recruited him to be the principal of Islamia College in Lahore. Later in life, he went again to England, where he died in London in December 1953. He is buried in the Muslim cemetery at Brookwood in Woking, Surrey.},

	abstract = {"Zen Buddhism is often said to be a practice of "mind-to-mind transmission" without reliance on texts - in fact, some great teachers forbid their students to read or write. But Buddhism has also inspired and accumulated some of the greatest philosophical texts of any religion. Two works lie at the center of Zen: The Heart Sutra, which monks recite all over the world, and The Diamond Sutra, which teaches the "perfection of wisdom" and cuts through all obstacles on the path of practice. It is perhaps the most studied of all the sutras, and by one count more than twenty thousand commentaries are noted." "Red Pine, as he begins his preface, explains: "The Diamond may look like a book, but it's really the body of the Buddha. It's also your body, my body, all possible bodies. But it's a body with nothing inside and nothing outside. It doesn't exist in space or time. Nor it is a construct of the mind. It's no mind. And yet because it's no mind, it has room for compassion. This book is the offering of no mind, born of compassion for all suffering beings. Of all the sutras that teach this teaching, this is the diamond. It cuts through all delusions, illuminates what is real, and cannot be destroyed. It is the path on which all buddhas stand and walk. And to read it is to stand and walk with buddhas."" "Red Pine, the translator and Buddhist scholar, has worked with this text for many years. He has consulted dozens of commentaries, in Chinese and in Sanskrit, to offer this brilliant new translation together with extensive commentary intended to present this sacred text in a new light. The result is a work of inspiration and guidance, a text of spiritual practice for all seekers."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc. All Rights Reserved},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the economic, legal, moral, and political difficulties in developing drugs for the developing world. It argues that large, global pharmaceutical companies have social responsibilities to the developing world, and that they may exercise these responsibilities by investing in research and development related to diseases that affect developing nations, offering discounts on drug prices, and initiating drug giveaways. However, these social responsibilities are not absolute requirements and may be balanced against other obligations and commitments in light of economic, social, legal, political, and other conditions. How a company decides to exercise its social responsibilities to the developing world depends on (1) the prospects for a reasonable profit and (2) the prospects for a productive business environment. Developing nations can either help or hinder the pharmaceutical industry’s efforts to exercise social responsibility through various policies and practices. To insure that companies can make a reasonable profit, developing nations should honor pharmaceutical product patents and adhere to international intellectual property treaties, such as the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. To insure the companies have a good business environment, developing nations should try to promote the rule of law, ethical business practices, stable currencies, reliable banking systems, free and open markets, democracy, and other conditions conducive to business. Overall, this paper advocates for reciprocity and cooperation between pharmaceutical companies and developing nations to address the problem of developing drugs for the developing world. In pursuing this cooperative approach, developing nations may use a variety of other techniques to encourage pharmaceutical companies to act responsibly, such as subsidizing pharmaceutical research, helping to design and implement research protocols, providing a guaranteed market, and bulk buying.},

We propose a modular regression model with interpretable parameters that can be intuitively adjusted by analysts with domain knowledge about the time series. We describe performance analyses to compare and evaluate forecasting procedures, and automatically flag forecasts for manual review and adjustment.

	abstract = {Background
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are extensively used in clinical practice because of their effectiveness and safety. Omeprazole is one of the best-selling drugs worldwide and, with other PPIs, has been proposed to be potential drugs for the treatment of several diseases. We demonstrated that omeprazole shows cytotoxic effects in Giardia and concomitantly inactivates giardial triosephosphate isomerase (GlTIM). Therefore, we evaluated the efficiency of commercially available PPIs to inactivate this enzyme.
Methods
We assayed the effect of PPIs on the GlTIM WT, single Cys mutants, and the human counterpart, following enzyme activity, thermal stability, exposure of hydrophobic regions, and susceptibility to limited proteolysis.
Results
PPIs efficiently inactivated GlTIM; however, rabeprazole was the best inactivating drug and was nearly ten times more effective. The mechanism of inactivation by PPIs was through the modification of the Cys 222 residue. Moreover, there are important changes at the structural level, the thermal stability of inactivated-GlTIM was drastically diminished and the structural rigidity was lost, as observed by the exposure of hydrophobic regions and their susceptibility to limited proteolysis.
Conclusions
Our results demonstrate that rabeprazole is the most potent PPI for GlTIM inactivation and that all PPIs tested have substantial abilities to alter GITIM at the structural level, causing serious damage. General significance. This is the first report demonstrating the effectiveness of commercial PPIs on a glycolytic parasitic enzyme, with structural features well known. This study is a step forward in the use and understanding the implicated mechanisms of new antigiardiasic drugs safe in humans.},

that the effect of I172A and L232A mutations on ΔG⧧ for the wild-type TbbTIM-catalyzed
reactions of the substrate pieces is nearly the same
as the effect of the same mutations on TbbTIM previously
mutated at the second side chain. This provides strong evidence that
mutation of the first hydrophobic side chain does not affect the functioning
of the second side chain in catalysis of the reactions of the substrate
pieces. By contrast, the effects of I172A and L232A mutations on ΔG⧧ for wild-type TbbTIM-catalyzed
reactions of the whole substrate are different from
the effect of the same mutations on TbbTIM previously
mutated at the second side chain. This is due to the change in the
rate-determining step that determines the barrier to the isomerization
reaction. X-ray crystal structures are reported for I172A, L232A,
and I172A/L232A TIMs and for the complexes of these mutants to the
intermediate analogue phosphoglycolate (PGA). The structures of the
PGA complexes with wild-type and mutant enzymes are nearly superimposable,
except that the space opened by replacement of the hydrophobic side
chain is occupied by a water molecule that lies ∼3.5 Å
from the basic side chain of Glu167. The new water at I172A mutant TbbTIM provides a simple rationalization for the increase
in the activation barrier ΔG⧧ observed for mutant enzyme-catalyzed
reactions of the whole substrate and substrate pieces. By contrast,
the new water at the L232A mutant does not predict the decrease in

We sequentially address early studies that motivated the method, canonical papers that established the use of MSMs for MD analysis, and subsequent advances in software and analysis protocols. The derivation of a variational principle for MSMs in 2013 signified a turning point from expertise-driving MSM building to a systematic, objective protocol. The variational approach, combined with best practices for model selection and open-source software, enabled a wide range of MSM analysis for applications such as protein folding and allostery, ligand binding, and protein–protein association. To conclude, the current frontiers of methods development are highlighted, as well as exciting applications in experimental design and drug discovery.},

	abstract = {The microsporidia are a large group of intracellular parasites with a broad range of hosts, including humans. Encephalitozoon intestinalis is the second microsporidia species most frequently associated with gastrointestinal disease in humans, especially immunocompromised or immunosuppressed individuals, including children and the elderly. The prevalence reported worldwide in these groups ranges from 0 to 60\%. Currently, albendazole is most commonly used to treat microsporidiosis caused by Encephalitozoon species. However, the results of treatment are variable, and relapse can occur. Consequently, efforts are being directed toward identifying more effective drugs for treating microsporidiosis, and the study of new molecular targets appears promising. These parasites lack mitochondria, and oxidative phosphorylation therefore does not occur, which suggests the enzymes involved in glycolysis as potential drug targets. Here, we have for the first time characterized the glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase of E. intestinalis at the functional and structural levels. Our results demonstrate the mechanisms of inactivation of this enzyme by thiol-reactive compounds. The most striking result of this study is the demonstration that established safe drugs such as omeprazole, rabeprazole and sulbutiamine can effectively inactivate this microsporidial enzyme and might be considered as potential drugs for treating this important disease.},

	abstract = {Conformational changes are crucial for the catalytic action of many enzymes. A prototypical and well-studied example is loop opening and closure in triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), which is thought to determine the rate of catalytic turnover in many circumstances. Specifically, TIM loop 6 “grips” the phosphodianion of the substrate and, together with a change in loop 7, sets up the TIM active site for efficient catalysis. Crystal structures of TIM typically show an open or a closed conformation of loop 6, with the tip of the loop moving ∼7 Å between conformations. Many studies have interpreted this motion as a two-state, rigid-body transition. Here, we use extensive molecular dynamics simulations, with both conventional and enhanced sampling techniques, to analyze loop motion in apo and substrate-bound TIM in detail, using five crystal structures of the dimeric TIM from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that loop 6 is highly flexible and samples multiple conformational states. Empirical valence bond simulations of the first reaction step show that slight displacements away from the fully closed-loop conformation can be sufficient to abolish most of the catalytic activity; full closure is required for efficient reaction. The conformational change of the loops in TIM is thus not a simple “open and shut” case and is crucial for its catalytic action. Our detailed analysis of loop motion in a highly efficient enzyme highlights the complexity of loop conformational changes and their role in biological catalysis.},

Both have two severe limitations: They handle only (1) simple (binary) join predicates and (2) inner joins. However, real queries may contain complex join predicates, involving more than two relations, and outer joins as well as other non-inner joins. Taking the most efficient known join-ordering algorithm, DPccp, as a starting point, we first develop a new algorithm, DPhyp, which is capable to handle complex join predicates efficiently. We do so by modeling the query graph as a (variant of a) hypergraph and then reason about its connected subgraphs. Then, we present a technique to exploit this capability to efficiently handle the widest class of non-inner joins dealt with so far. Our experimental results show that this reformulation of non-inner joins as complex predicates can improve optimization time by orders of magnitude, compared to known algorithms dealing with complex join predicates and non-inner joins. Once again, this gives dynamic programming a distinct advantage over current memoization techniques.},

Within this unique technology is perhaps a more unambiguous form of gambling – in-play betting. This live betting scenario offers a rare insight into the peaks and troughs of betting odds throughout the duration of various sporting events. Horse racing is a sport unanimously associated with the punter and gambling and coupled with its in-play options, is an ideal area to analyse. In-play betting provides a plethora of potential analysis but perhaps the most intriguing of which is time series analysis. From start to finish, time stamped data of racing odds can be analysed to better understand the nature of the odds fluctuations and may even lay the foundations for potential race prediction and forecasting. This project will research horse racing data through time series analysis across a multitude of races whilst attempting to forecast a winning event (horse) based on the previous odds during the race, through the implementation of the R programming language and WEKA data mining interface.},

The predictions implied by the betting odds match the model predictions closely, with an extremely high correlation being found between the model and the betting market. The results for both men’s and women’s matches also suggest that there is a high level of efficiency in the betting market, demonstrating that betting markets are a good predictor of the outcomes of tennis matches. The significance of service breaks and service being held is anticipated up to four points prior to the end of the game. However, the tendency of players to lose more points than would be expected after conceding a break of service is not captured instantaneously in betting odds. In contrast, there is no evidence of a biased reaction to a player winning a game on service.},

	abstract = {In protein and RNA macromolecules, only a limited number of different side-chain chemical groups are available to function as catalysts. The myriad of enzyme-catalyzed reactions results from the ability of most of these groups to function either as nucleophilic, electrophilic, or general acid-base catalysts, and the key to their adapted chemical function lies in their states of protonation. Ionization is determined by the intrinsic pKa of the group and the microenvironment created around the group by the protein or RNA structure, which perturbs its intrinsic pKa to its functional or apparent pKa. These pKa shifts result from interactions of the catalytic group with other fully or partially charged groups as well as the polarity or dielectric of the medium that surrounds it. The electrostatic interactions between ionizable groups found on the surface of macromolecules are weak and cause only slight pKa perturbations ({\textless}2 units). The sum of many of these weak electrostatic interactions helps contribute to the stability of native or folded macromolecules and their ligand complexes. However, the pKa values of catalytic groups that are found in the active sites of numerous enzymes are significantly more perturbed ({\textgreater}2 units) and are the subject of this review. The magnitudes of these pKa perturbations are analyzed with respect to the structural details of the active-site microenvironment and the energetics of the reactions that they catalyze.},

Glu-461 and Tyr-503 were replaced, independently, with 13 amino acids. All 26 of the strains containing mutant enzymes are Lac(-). Enzyme activity is reduced to less than 10\% of wild type by substitutions at Glu-461 and to less than 1\% of wild type by substitutions at Tyr-503. Many of the mutant enzymes have less than 0.1\% wild-type activity. His-464 and Met-3 were replaced with 11 and 12 amino acids, respectively.

The main idea is to allow nonserializable schedules which preserve consistency and which are acceptable to the system users. To produce such schedules, the transaction processing mechanism receives semantic information from the users in the form of transaction semantic types, a division of transactions into steps, compatibility sets, and countersteps. Using these notions, we propose a mechanism which allows users to exploit their semantic knowledge in an organized fashion. The strengths and weaknesses of this approach are discussed.},

A model that makes it possible to compare the cost of allocations is presented; the cost can be computed for different cost functions and for processing schedules produced by arbitrary query processing algorithms. For minimizing the total transmission cost, a method is proposed to determine the fragments to be allocated from the relations in the conceptual schema and the queries and updates executed by the users. For the same cost function, the complexity of the data allocation problem is investigated. Methods for obtaining optimal and heuristic solutions under various ways of computing the cost of an allocation are presented and compared.

Although the LRU-K approach performs optimal statistical inference under relatively standard assmuptions, it is fairly simple and incurs little bookkeeping overhead. As we demonstrate with simulation experiments, the LRU-K algorithm surpasses conventional buffering algorithms in discriminating between frequently and infrequently referenced pages. In fact, LRU-K an approach the behavior of buffering algorithms in which page sets with known access frequencies are manually assigned to different buffer pools of specifically tuned sizes. Unlike such customized buffering algorithms however, the LRU-K method is self-tuning, and does not rely on external hints about workload characteristics. Furthermore, the LRU-K algo rithm adapts in real time to changing patterns of access.},

The manual also includes an introduction to ethics in the laboratory, uncommon in similar manuals.  Most importantly, perhaps, is the authors’ three-pronged approach to encouraging students to think like a research scientist: first, the authors introduce the scientific method and the hypothesis as a framework for developing conclusive experiments; second, the manual’s experiments are designed to become increasingly complex in order to teach more advanced techniques and analysis; finally, gradually, the students are required to devise their own protocols.   In this way, students and instructors are able to break away from a “cookbook” approach and to think and investigate for themselves. Suitable for lower-level and upper-level courses; Ninfa spans these courses and can also be used for some first-year graduate work.},

We performed predictions on multiple chemical libraries and discovered a molecule from the Drug Repurposing Hub—halicin—that is structurally divergent from conventional antibiotics and displays bactericidal activity against a wide phylogenetic spectrum of pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Halicin also effectively treated Clostridioides difﬁcile and pan-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections in murine models. Additionally, from a discrete set of 23 empirically tested predictions from {\textgreater}107 million molecules curated from the ZINC15 database, our model identiﬁed eight antibacterial compounds that are structurally distant from known antibiotics.

The infection of SARS-CoV is mediated mainly through the viral surface glycoproteins, which consist of S1 and S2 subunits and form trimer spikes on the envelope of the virions. Here we report the ectodomain structures of the SARS-CoV surface spike trimer in different conformational states determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The conformation 1 determined at 4.3 Å resolution is three-fold symmetric and has all the three receptor-binding C-terminal domain 1 (CTD1s) of the S1 subunits in “down” positions. The binding of the “down” CTD1s to the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 is not possible due to steric clashes, suggesting that the conformation 1 represents a receptor-binding inactive state. Conformations 2-4 determined at 7.3, 5.7 and 6.8 Å resolutions are all asymmetric, in which one RBD rotates away from the “down” position by different angles to an “up” position. The “up” CTD1 exposes the receptor-binding site for ACE2 engagement, suggesting that the conformations 2-4 represent a receptor-binding active state. This conformational change is also required for the binding of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies targeting the CTD1. This phenomenon could be extended to other betacoronaviruses utilizing CTD1 of the S1 subunit for receptor binding, which provides new insights into the intermediate states of coronavirus pre-fusion spike trimer during infection.},

A prominent example is Vibrio cholerae, which relies on the Na+-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) as the first complex in its respiratory chain. The Na+-NQR is a multisubunit, membrane-embedded NADH dehydrogenase that oxidizes NADH and reduces quinone to quinol. Existing models describing redox-driven Na+ translocation by the Na+-NQR are based on the assumption that the pump contains four flavins and one FeS cluster. Here we show that the large, peripheral NqrA subunit of the Na+-NQR binds one molecule of ubiquinone-8. Investigations of the dynamic interaction of NqrA with quinones by surface plasmon resonance and saturation transfer difference NMR reveal a high affinity, which is determined by the methoxy groups at the C-2 and C-3 positions of the quinone headgroup. Using photoactivatable quinone derivatives, it is demonstrated that ubiquinone-8 bound to NqrA occupies a functional site. A novel scheme of electron transfer in Na+-NQR is proposed that is initiated by NADH oxidation on subunit NqrF and leads to quinol formation on subunit NqrA.},

We report the 3.0 Å-resolution crystal structure of MERS-CoV RBD bound to the extracellular domain of human DPP4. Our results show that MERS-CoV RBD consists of a core and a receptor-binding subdomain. The receptor-binding subdomain interacts with DPP4 β-propeller but not its intrinsic hydrolase domain. MERS-CoV RBD and related SARS-CoV RBD share a high degree of structural similarity in their core subdomains, but are notably divergent in the receptor-binding subdomain. Mutagenesis studies have identified several key residues in the receptor-binding subdomain that are critical for viral binding to DPP4 and entry into the target cell. The atomic details at the interface between MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4 provide structural understanding of the virus and receptor interaction, which can guide development of therapeutics and vaccines against MERS-CoV infection.},

Here we show that a recombinant fusion protein (designated RBD-Fc) containing 193-amino acid RBD (residues 318–510) and a human IgG1 Fc fragment can induce highly potent antibody responses in the immunized rabbits. The antibodies recognized RBD on S1 domain and completely inhibited SARS-CoV infection at a serum dilution of 1:10,240. Rabbit antisera effectively blocked binding of S1, which contains RBD, to ACE2.

	abstract = {The trimeric SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) surface spike (S) glycoprotein consisting of three S1-S2 heterodimers binds the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and mediates fusion of the viral and cellular membranes through a pre- to postfusion conformation transition. Here, we report the structure of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein in complex with its host cell receptor ACE2 revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The complex structure shows that only one receptor-binding domain of the trimeric S glycoprotein binds ACE2 and adopts a protruding “up” conformation. In addition, we studied the structures of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and its complexes with ACE2 in different in vitro conditions, which may mimic different conformational states of the S glycoprotein during virus entry. Disassociation of the S1-ACE2 complex from some of the prefusion spikes was observed and characterized. We also characterized the rosette-like structures of the clustered SARS-CoV S2 trimers in the postfusion state observed on electron micrographs. Structural comparisons suggested that the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein retains a prefusion architecture after trypsin cleavage into the S1 and S2 subunits and acidic pH treatment. However, binding to the receptor opens up the receptor-binding domain of S1, which could promote the release of the S1-ACE2 complex and S1 monomers from the prefusion spike and trigger the pre- to postfusion conformational transition., The global outbreak of SARS in 2002–2003 was caused by infection by a human coronavirus, SARS-CoV. Although the virus has been extensively studied with regard to epidemiology, virology, clinical features and other aspects, there are still no approved antiviral drugs and vaccines to treat and prevent infections of SARS-CoV. The spike (S) glycoprotein of the coronavirus, responsible for host cell attachment and mediating host cell membrane and viral membrane fusion during infection, is key to the viral life cycle and a major target for antiviral drugs and vaccines. In this study, we report the structures of different conformational states of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein during virus entry. Specifically, we found that the S glycoprotein retains the prefusion trimer structure after trypsin cleavage and low-pH treatment. Additionally, binding with host cell receptor ACE2 promotes the release of S1 subunits from the S trimer and triggers the pre- to postfusion conformational transition. Our results provide new insights for understanding the mechanisms involved in coronavirus S glycoprotein-mediated virus entry.},

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious viral disease characterized by severe clinical manifestations of the lower respiratory tract. The pathogenesis of SARS is highly complex, with multiple factors leading to severe injury in the lungs and dissemination of the virus to several other organs. The SARS coronavirus targets the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. Several organs/cell types may be infected in the course of the illness, including mucosal cells of the intestines, tubular epithelial cells of the kidneys, neurons of the brain, and several types of immune cells, and certain organs may suffer from indirect injury. Extensive studies have provided a basic understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease. In this review we describe the most significant pathological features of SARS, explore the etiological factors causing these pathological changes, and discuss the major pathogenetic mechanisms. The latter include dysregulation of cytokines/chemokines, deficiencies in the innate immune response, direct infection of immune cells, direct viral cytopathic effects, down-regulation of lung protective angiotensin converting enzyme 2, autoimmunity, and genetic factors. It seems that both abnormal immune responses and injury to immune cells may be key factors in the pathogenesis of this new disease.},

	abstract = {Much progress has been made in understanding the role of structural and accessory proteins in the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections. The SARS epidemic also brought new attention to the proteins translated from ORF1a and ORF1b of the input genome RNA, also known as the replicase/transcriptase gene. Evidence for change within the ORF1ab coding sequence during the SARS epidemic, as well as evidence from studies with other coronaviruses, indicates that it is likely that the ORF1ab proteins play roles in virus pathogenesis distinct from or in addition to functions directly involved in viral replication. Recent reverse genetic studies have confirmed that proteins of ORF1ab may be involved in cellular signaling and modification of cellular gene expression, as well as virulence by mechanisms yet to be determined. Thus, the evolution of the ORF1ab proteins may be determined as much by issues of host range and virulence as they are by specific requirements for intracellular replication.},

	abstract = {The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has led to a renewed interest in studying the role of accessory proteins in regulating coronavirus infections in the natural host. A significant body of evidence has accumulated in the area of SARS-CoV and host interactions that indicate that the accessory proteins might play an important role in modulating the host response to virus infection and thereby, contribute to pathogenesis. In this review, we have compiled the current knowledge about SARS-CoV accessory proteins, obtained from studies in cell culture systems, reverse genetics and animal models, to shed some light into the possible role of these proteins in the propagation and virulence of SARS-CoV in its natural host. We conclude by providing some questions for future studies that will greatly advance our knowledge about the biological significance and contributions of the accessory proteins in the development of SARS in humans.},
